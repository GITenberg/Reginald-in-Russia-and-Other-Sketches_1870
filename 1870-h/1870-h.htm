REGINALD</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He is a delightful person.&nbsp; One would
not like a rich and octogenarian uncle to suppose that Reginald
was one&rsquo;s ideal of conduct and conversion.&nbsp; Yet there
is sometimes reason in his paradoxical frivolities, and justice
in his practical performances.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Morning
Post</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The book, by reason of its sustained brilliance, may be
likened to a Brock&rsquo;s Benefit at the Crystal
Palace.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. H. H. Munro (&lsquo;Saki&rsquo;) has one of the
lightest and most entertaining touches of the humorists of the
day . . .&nbsp; The book is admirable comedy and free from malice
and bad taste.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Queen</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We feel sure that those who have already made
Reginald&rsquo;s acquaintance will be glad to renew it, and that
those who know him not will not regret it if they add him to the
list of their fictitious (albeit very real) acquaintances, not to
say friends.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Westminster Gazette</i>.</p>

1</span>REGINALD IN RUSSIA</h2>
<p>Reginald sat in a corner of the Princess&rsquo;s salon and
tried to forgive the furniture, which started out with an obvious
intention of being Louis Quinze, but relapsed at frequent
intervals into Wilhelm II.</p>
<p>He classified the Princess with that distinct type of woman
that looks as if it habitually went out to feed hens in the
rain.</p>
<p>Her name was Olga; she kept what she hoped and believed to be
a fox-terrier, and professed what she thought were Socialist
opinions.&nbsp; It is not necessary to be called Olga if you are
a Russian Princess; in fact, Reginald knew quite a number who
were called Vera; but the fox-terrier and the Socialism are
essential.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Countess Lomshen keeps a bull-dog,&rdquo; said the
Princess suddenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;In England is it more chic to
have a bull-dog than a fox-terrier?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>Reginald threw his mind back over the canine fashions of
the last ten years and gave an evasive answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think her handsome, the Countess Lomshen?&rdquo;
asked the Princess.</p>
<p>Reginald thought the Countess&rsquo;s complexion suggested an
exclusive diet of macaroons and pale sherry.&nbsp; He said
so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that cannot be possible,&rdquo; said the Princess
triumphantly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen her eating fish-soup at
Donon&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess always defended a friend&rsquo;s complexion if it
was really bad.&nbsp; With her, as with a great many of her sex,
charity began at homeliness and did not generally progress much
farther.</p>
<p>Reginald withdrew his macaroon and sherry theory, and became
interested in a case of miniatures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That?&rdquo; said the Princess; &ldquo;that is the old
Princess Lorikoff.&nbsp; She lived in Millionaya Street, near the
Winter Palace, and was one of the Court ladies of the old Russian
school.&nbsp; Her knowledge of people and events was extremely
limited; but she used to patronise every one who came in contact
with her.&nbsp; There was a story that when she died and left the
Millionaya for Heaven she addressed <!-- page 3--><a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>St. Peter in
her formal staccato French: &lsquo;Je suis la Princesse
Lor-i-koff.&nbsp; Il me donne grand plaisir &agrave; faire votre
connaissance.&nbsp; Je vous en prie me pr&eacute;senter au Bon
Dieu.&rsquo;&nbsp; St. Peter made the desired introduction, and
the Princess addressed le Bon Dieu: &lsquo;Je suis la Princesse
Lor-i-koff.&nbsp; Il me donne grand plaisir &agrave; faire votre
connaissance.&nbsp; On a souvent parl&eacute; de vous &agrave;
l&rsquo;&eacute;glise de la rue Million.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the old and the clergy of Established churches
know how to be flippant gracefully,&rdquo; commented Reginald;
&ldquo;which reminds me that in the Anglican Church in a certain
foreign capital, which shall be nameless, I was present the other
day when one of the junior chaplains was preaching in aid of
distressed somethings or other, and he brought a really eloquent
passage to a close with the remark, &lsquo;The tears of the
afflicted, to what shall I liken them&mdash;to
diamonds?&rsquo;&nbsp; The other junior chaplain, who had been
dozing out of professional jealousy, awoke with a start and asked
hurriedly, &lsquo;Shall I play to diamonds, partner?&rsquo;&nbsp;
It didn&rsquo;t improve matters when the senior chaplain remarked
dreamily but with painful distinctness, &lsquo;Double
diamonds.&rsquo;&nbsp; Every one looked <!-- page 4--><a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>at the
preacher, half expecting him to redouble, but he contented
himself with scoring what points he could under the
circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You English are always so frivolous,&rdquo; said the
Princess.&nbsp; &ldquo;In Russia we have too many troubles to
permit of our being light-hearted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reginald gave a delicate shiver, such as an Italian greyhound
might give in contemplating the approach of an ice age of which
he personally disapproved, and resigned himself to the inevitable
political discussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing that you hear about us in England is
true,&rdquo; was the Princess&rsquo;s hopeful beginning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always refused to learn Russian geography at
school,&rdquo; observed Reginald; &ldquo;I was certain some of
the names must be wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is wrong with our system of
government,&rdquo; continued the Princess placidly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Bureaucrats think only of their pockets, and the
people are exploited and plundered in every direction, and
everything is mismanaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With us,&rdquo; said Reginald, &ldquo;a Cabinet usually
gets the credit of being depraved and worthless beyond the bounds
of human <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>conception by the time it has been in
office about four years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if it is a bad Government you can turn it out at
the elections,&rdquo; argued the Princess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as I remember, we generally do,&rdquo; said
Reginald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But here it is dreadful, every one goes to such
extremes.&nbsp; In England you never go to extremes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We go to the Albert Hall,&rdquo; explained
Reginald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is always a see-saw with us between repression
and violence,&rdquo; continued the Princess; &ldquo;and the pity
of it is the people are really not in the least inclined to be
anything but peaceable.&nbsp; Nowhere will you find people more
good-natured, or family circles where there is more
affection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There I agree with you,&rdquo; said Reginald.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know a boy who lives somewhere on the French Quay who is
a case in point.&nbsp; His hair curls naturally, especially on
Sundays, and he plays bridge well, even for a Russian, which is
saying much.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think he has any other
accomplishments, but his family affection is really of a very
high order.&nbsp; When his maternal grandmother died he
didn&rsquo;t go as far as to give up bridge altogether, <!-- page
6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>but he
declared on nothing but black suits for the next three
months.&nbsp; That, I think, was really beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess was not impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you must be very self-indulgent and live only
for amusement,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;a life of pleasure-seeking
and card-playing and dissipation brings only
dissatisfaction.&nbsp; You will find that out some
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know it turns out that way sometimes,&rdquo;
assented Reginald.&nbsp; &ldquo;Forbidden fizz is often the
sweetest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the remark was wasted on the Princess, who preferred
champagne that had at least a suggestion of dissolved
barley-sugar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will come and see me again,&rdquo; she said,
in a tone that prevented the hope from becoming too infectious;
adding as a happy afterthought, &ldquo;you must come to stay with
us in the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her particular part of the country was a few hundred versts
the other side of Tamboff, with some fifteen miles of agrarian
disturbance between her and the nearest neighbour.&nbsp; Reginald
felt that there is some privacy which should be sacred from
intrusion.</p>
<h2><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>THE RETICENCE OF LADY ANNE</h2>
<p>Egbert came into the large, dimly lit drawing-room with the
air of a man who is not certain whether he is entering a dovecote
or a bomb factory, and is prepared for either eventuality.&nbsp;
The little domestic quarrel over the luncheon-table had not been
fought to a definite finish, and the question was how far Lady
Anne was in a mood to renew or forgo hostilities.&nbsp; Her pose
in the arm-chair by the tea-table was rather elaborately rigid;
in the gloom of a December afternoon Egbert&rsquo;s pince-nez did
not materially help him to discern the expression of her
face.</p>
<p>By way of breaking whatever ice might be floating on the
surface he made a remark about a dim religious light.&nbsp; He or
Lady Anne were accustomed to make that remark between 4.30 and 6
on winter and late <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>autumn evenings; it was a part of
their married life.&nbsp; There was no recognised rejoinder to
it, and Lady Anne made none.</p>
<p>Don Tarquinio lay astretch on the Persian rug, basking in the
firelight with superb indifference to the possible ill-humour of
Lady Anne.&nbsp; His pedigree was as flawlessly Persian as the
rug, and his ruff was coming into the glory of its second
winter.&nbsp; The page-boy, who had Renaissance tendencies, had
christened him Don Tarquinio.&nbsp; Left to themselves, Egbert
and Lady Anne would unfailingly have called him Fluff, but they
were not obstinate.</p>
<p>Egbert poured himself out some tea.&nbsp; As the silence gave
no sign of breaking on Lady Anne&rsquo;s initiative, he braced
himself for another Yermak effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My remark at lunch had a purely academic
application,&rdquo; he announced; &ldquo;you seem to put an
unnecessarily personal significance into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Anne maintained her defensive barrier of silence.&nbsp;
The bullfinch lazily filled in the interval with an air from
<i>Iphig&eacute;nie en Tauride</i>.&nbsp; Egbert recognised it
immediately, because it was the only air the bullfinch whistled,
and he had come to them <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>with the reputation for whistling
it.&nbsp; Both Egbert and Lady Anne would have preferred
something from <i>The Yeomen of the Guard</i>, which was their
favourite opera.&nbsp; In matters artistic they had a similarity
of taste.&nbsp; They leaned towards the honest and explicit in
art, a picture, for instance, that told its own story, with
generous assistance from its title.&nbsp; A riderless warhorse
with harness in obvious disarray, staggering into a courtyard
full of pale swooning women, and marginally noted &ldquo;Bad
News&rdquo;, suggested to their minds a distinct interpretation
of some military catastrophe.&nbsp; They could see what it was
meant to convey, and explain it to friends of duller
intelligence.</p>
<p>The silence continued.&nbsp; As a rule Lady Anne&rsquo;s
displeasure became articulate and markedly voluble after four
minutes of introductory muteness.&nbsp; Egbert seized the
milk-jug and poured some of its contents into Don
Tarquinio&rsquo;s saucer; as the saucer was already full to the
brim an unsightly overflow was the result.&nbsp; Don Tarquinio
looked on with a surprised interest that evanesced into elaborate
unconsciousness when he was appealed to by Egbert to come and
drink up some of the spilt matter.&nbsp; Don Tarquinio was
prepared <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>to play many r&ocirc;les in life, but
a vacuum carpet-cleaner was not one of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;re being rather
foolish?&rdquo; said Egbert cheerfully.</p>
<p>If Lady Anne thought so she didn&rsquo;t say so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say the fault has been partly on my side,&rdquo;
continued Egbert, with evaporating cheerfulness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;After all, I&rsquo;m only human, you know.&nbsp; You seem
to forget that I&rsquo;m only human.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He insisted on the point, as if there had been unfounded
suggestions that he was built on Satyr lines, with goat
continuations where the human left off.</p>
<p>The bullfinch recommenced its air from <i>Iphig&eacute;nie en
Tauride</i>.&nbsp; Egbert began to feel depressed.&nbsp; Lady
Anne was not drinking her tea.&nbsp; Perhaps she was feeling
unwell.&nbsp; But when Lady Anne felt unwell she was not wont to
be reticent on the subject.&nbsp; &ldquo;No one knows what I
suffer from indigestion&rdquo; was one of her favourite
statements; but the lack of knowledge can only have been caused
by defective listening; the amount of information available on
the subject would have supplied material for a monograph.</p>
<p>Evidently Lady Anne was not feeling unwell.</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>Egbert began to think he was being unreasonably dealt
with; naturally he began to make concessions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; he observed, taking as central a
position on the hearth-rug as Don Tarquinio could be persuaded to
concede him, &ldquo;I may have been to blame.&nbsp; I am willing,
if I can thereby restore things to a happier standpoint, to
undertake to lead a better life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wondered vaguely how it would be possible.&nbsp;
Temptations came to him, in middle age, tentatively and without
insistence, like a neglected butcher-boy who asks for a Christmas
box in February for no more hopeful reason that than he
didn&rsquo;t get one in December.&nbsp; He had no more idea of
succumbing to them than he had of purchasing the fish-knives and
fur boas that ladies are impelled to sacrifice through the medium
of advertisement columns during twelve months of the year.&nbsp;
Still, there was something impressive in this unasked-for
renunciation of possibly latent enormities.</p>
<p>Lady Anne showed no sign of being impressed.</p>
<p>Egbert looked at her nervously through his glasses.&nbsp; To
get the worst of an argument with her was no new
experience.&nbsp; To get the <!-- page 12--><a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>worst of a
monologue was a humiliating novelty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go and dress for diner,&rdquo; he announced in
a voice into which he intended some shade of sternness to
creep.</p>
<p>At the door a final access of weakness impelled him to make a
further appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we being very silly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fool&rdquo; was Don Tarquinio&rsquo;s mental comment
as the door closed on Egbert&rsquo;s retreat.&nbsp; Then he
lifted his velvet forepaws in the air and leapt lightly on to a
bookshelf immediately under the bullfinch&rsquo;s cage.&nbsp; It
was the first time he had seemed to notice the bird&rsquo;s
existence, but he was carrying out a long-formed theory of action
with the precision of mature deliberation.&nbsp; The bullfinch,
who had fancied himself something of a despot, depressed himself
of a sudden into a third of his normal displacement; then he fell
to a helpless wing-beating and shrill cheeping.&nbsp; He had cost
twenty-seven shillings without the cage, but Lady Anne made no
sign of interfering.&nbsp; She had been dead for two hours.</p>
<h2><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>THE LOST SANJAK</h2>
<p>The prison Chaplain entered the condemned&rsquo;s cell for the
last time, to give such consolation as he might.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only consolation I crave for,&rdquo; said the
condemned, &ldquo;is to tell my story in its entirety to some one
who will at least give it a respectful hearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must not be too long over it,&rdquo; said the
Chaplain, looking at his watch.</p>
<p>The condemned repressed a shiver and commenced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most people will be of opinion that I am paying the
penalty of my own violent deeds.&nbsp; In reality I am a victim
to a lack of specialisation in my education and
character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lack of specialisation!&rdquo; said the Chaplain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; If I had been known as one of the few men in
England familiar with the fauna of the Outer Hebrides, or able to
repeat <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>stanzas of Camoens&rsquo; poetry in
the original, I should have had no difficulty in proving my
identity in the crisis when my identity became a matter of life
and death for me.&nbsp; But my education was merely a moderately
good one, and my temperament was of the general order that avoids
specialisation.&nbsp; I know a little in a general way about
gardening and history and old masters, but I could never tell you
off-hand whether &lsquo;Stella van der Loopen&rsquo; was a
chrysanthemum or a heroine of the American War of Independence,
or something by Romney in the Louvre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chaplain shifted uneasily in his seat.&nbsp; Now that the
alternatives had been suggested they all seemed dreadfully
possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fell in love, or thought I did, with the local
doctor&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; continued the condemned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why I should have done so, I cannot say, for I do not
remember that she possessed any particular attractions of mind or
body.&nbsp; On looking back at past events if seems to me that
she must have been distinctly ordinary, but I suppose the doctor
had fallen in love with her once, and what man had done man can
do.&nbsp; She appeared to be pleased with the attentions which I
paid her, <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>and to that extent I suppose I might
say she encouraged me, but I think she was honestly unaware that
I meant anything more than a little neighbourly interest.&nbsp;
When one is face to face with Death one wishes to be
just.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chaplain murmured approval.&nbsp; &ldquo;At any rate, she
was genuinely horrified when I took advantage of the
doctor&rsquo;s absence one evening to declare what I believed to
be my passion.&nbsp; She begged me to pass out of her life, and I
could scarcely do otherwise than agree, though I hadn&rsquo;t the
dimmest idea of how it was to be done.&nbsp; In novels and plays
I knew it was a regular occurrence, and if you mistook a
lady&rsquo;s sentiments or intentions you went off to India and
did things on the frontier as a matter of course.&nbsp; As I
stumbled along the doctor&rsquo;s carriage-drive I had no very
clear idea as to what my line of action was to be, but I had a
vague feeling that I must look at the <i>Times</i> Atlas before
going to bed.&nbsp; Then, on the dark and lonely highway, I came
suddenly on a dead body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chaplain&rsquo;s interest in the story visibly
quickened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judging by the clothes it wore, the corpse <!-- page
16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>was
that of a Salvation Army captain.&nbsp; Some shocking accident
seemed to have struck him down, and the head was crushed and
battered out of all human semblance.&nbsp; Probably, I thought, a
motor-car fatality; and then, with a sudden overmastering
insistence, came another thought, that here was a remarkable
opportunity for losing my identity and passing out of the life of
the doctor&rsquo;s wife for ever.&nbsp; No tiresome and risky
voyage to distant lands, but a mere exchange of clothes and
identity with the unknown victim of an unwitnessed
accident.&nbsp; With considerable difficulty I undressed the
corpse, and clothed it anew in my own garments.&nbsp; Any one who
has valeted a dead Salvation Army captain in an uncertain light
will appreciate the difficulty.&nbsp; With the idea, presumably,
of inducing the doctor&rsquo;s wife to leave her husband&rsquo;s
roof-tree for some habitation which would be run at my expense, I
had crammed my pockets with a store of banknotes, which
represented a good deal of my immediate worldly wealth.&nbsp;
When, therefore, I stole away into the world in the guise of a
nameless Salvationist, I was not without resources which would
easily support so humble a r&ocirc;le for a considerable
period.&nbsp; I tramped to a <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>neighbouring
market-town, and, late as the hour was, the production of a few
shillings procured me supper and a night&rsquo;s lodging in a
cheap coffee-house.&nbsp; The next day I started forth on an
aimless course of wandering from one small town to another.&nbsp;
I was already somewhat disgusted with the upshot of my sudden
freak; in a few hours&rsquo; time I was considerably more
so.&nbsp; In the contents-bill of a local news sheet I read the
announcement of my own murder at the hands of some person
unknown; on buying a copy of the paper for a detailed account of
the tragedy, which at first had aroused in me a certain grim
amusement, I found that the deed ascribed to a wandering
Salvationist of doubtful antecedents, who had been seen lurking
in the roadway near the scene of the crime.&nbsp; I was no longer
amused.&nbsp; The matter promised to be embarrassing.&nbsp; What
I had mistaken for a motor accident was evidently a case of
savage assault and murder, and, until the real culprit was found,
I should have much difficulty in explaining my intrusion into the
affair.&nbsp; Of course I could establish my own identity; but
how, without disagreeably involving the doctor&rsquo;s wife,
could I give any adequate reason for <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>changing
clothes with the murdered man?&nbsp; While my brain worked
feverishly at this problem, I subconsciously obeyed a secondary
instinct&mdash;to get as far away as possible from the scene of
the crime, and to get rid at all costs of my incriminating
uniform.&nbsp; There I found a difficulty.&nbsp; I tried two or
three obscure clothes shops, but my entrance invariably aroused
an attitude of hostile suspicion in the proprietors, and on one
excuse or another they avoided serving me with the now ardently
desired change of clothing.&nbsp; The uniform that I had so
thoughtlessly donned seemed as difficult to get out of as the
fatal shirt of&mdash;You know, I forget the creature&rsquo;s
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the Chaplain hurriedly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go on with your story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow, until I could get out of those compromising
garments, I felt it would not be safe to surrender myself to the
police.&nbsp; The thing that puzzled me was why no attempt was
made to arrest me, since there was no question as to the
suspicion which followed me, like an inseparable shadow, wherever
I went.&nbsp; Stares, nudgings, whisperings, and even loud-spoken
remarks of &lsquo;that&rsquo;s &rsquo;im&rsquo; greeted my every
appearance, and the <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>meanest and most deserted
eating-house that I patronised soon became filled with a crowd of
furtively watching customers.&nbsp; I began to sympathise with
the feeling of Royal personages trying to do a little private
shopping under the unsparing scrutiny of an irrepressible
public.&nbsp; And still, with all this inarticulate shadowing,
which weighed on my nerves almost worse than open hostility would
have done, no attempt was made to interfere with my
liberty.&nbsp; Later on I discovered the reason.&nbsp; At the
time of the murder on the lonely highway a series of important
bloodhound trials had been taking place in the near
neighbourhood, and some dozen and a half couples of trained
animals had been put on the track of the supposed
murderer&mdash;on my track.&nbsp; One of our most public-spirited
London dailies had offered a princely prize to the owner of the
pair that should first track me down, and betting on the chances
of the respective competitors became rife throughout the
land.&nbsp; The dogs ranged far and wide over about thirteen
counties, and though my own movements had become by this time
perfectly well-known to police and public alike, the sporting
instincts of the nation stepped in to prevent <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>my premature
arrest.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give the dogs a chance,&rdquo; was the
prevailing sentiment, whenever some ambitious local constable
wished to put an end to my drawn-out evasion of justice.&nbsp; My
final capture by the winning pair was not a very dramatic
episode, in fact, I&rsquo;m not sure that they would have taken
any notice of me if I hadn&rsquo;t spoken to them and patted
them, but the event gave rise to an extraordinary amount of
partisan excitement.&nbsp; The owner of the pair who were next
nearest up at the finish was an American, and he lodged a protest
on the ground that an otterhound had married into the family of
the winning pair six generations ago, and that the prize had been
offered to the first pair of bloodhounds to capture the murderer,
and that a dog that had 1/64th part of otterhound blood in it
couldn&rsquo;t technically be considered a bloodhound.&nbsp; I
forget how the matter was ultimately settled, but it aroused a
tremendous amount of acrimonious discussion on both sides of the
Atlantic.&nbsp; My own contribution to the controversy consisted
in pointing out that the whole dispute was beside the mark, as
the actual murderer had not yet been captured; but I soon
discovered that on this point there was not the <!-- page 21--><a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>least
divergence of public or expert opinion.&nbsp; I had looked
forward apprehensively to the proving of my identity and the
establishment of my motives as a disagreeable necessity; I
speedily found out that the most disagreeable part of the
business was that it couldn&rsquo;t be done.&nbsp; When I saw in
the glass the haggard and hunted expression which the experiences
of the past few weeks had stamped on my erstwhile placid
countenance, I could scarcely feel surprised that the few friends
and relations I possessed refused to recognise me in my altered
guise, and persisted in their obstinate but widely shared belief
that it was I who had been done to death on the highway.&nbsp; To
make matters worse, infinitely worse, an aunt of the really
murdered man, an appalling female of an obviously low order of
intelligence, identified me as her nephew, and gave the
authorities a lurid account of my depraved youth and of her
laudable but unavailing efforts to spank me into a better
way.&nbsp; I believe it was even proposed to search me for
fingerprints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the Chaplain, &ldquo;surely your
educational attainments&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was just the crucial point,&rdquo; said the <!--
page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>condemned; &ldquo;that was where my lack of
specialisation told so fatally against me.&nbsp; The dead
Salvationist, whose identity I had so lightly and so disastrously
adopted, had possessed a veneer of cheap modern education.&nbsp;
It should have been easy to demonstrate that my learning was on
altogether another plane to his, but in my nervousness I bungled
miserably over test after test that was put to me.&nbsp; The
little French I had ever known deserted me; I could not render a
simple phrase about the gooseberry of the gardener into that
language, because I had forgotten the French for
gooseberry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chaplain again wriggled uneasily in his seat.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; resumed the condemned, &ldquo;came the
final discomfiture.&nbsp; In our village we had a modest little
debating club, and I remembered having promised, chiefly, I
suppose, to please and impress the doctor&rsquo;s wife, to give a
sketchy kind of lecture on the Balkan Crisis.&nbsp; I had relied
on being able to get up my facts from one or two standard works,
and the back-numbers of certain periodicals.&nbsp; The
prosecution had made a careful note of the circumstance that the
man whom I claimed to be&mdash;and <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>actually
was&mdash;had posed locally as some sort of second-hand authority
on Balkan affairs, and, in the midst of a string of questions on
indifferent topics, the examining counsel asked me with a
diabolical suddenness if I could tell the Court the whereabouts
of Novibazar.&nbsp; I felt the question to be a crucial one;
something told me that the answer was St. Petersburg or Baker
Street.&nbsp; I hesitated, looked helplessly round at the sea of
tensely expectant faces, pulled myself together, and chose Baker
Street.&nbsp; And then I knew that everything was lost.&nbsp; The
prosecution had no difficulty in demonstrating that an
individual, even moderately versed in the affairs of the Near
East, could never have so unceremoniously dislocated Novibazar
from its accustomed corner of the map.&nbsp; It was an answer
which the Salvation Army captain might conceivably have
made&mdash;and I made it.&nbsp; The circumstantial evidence
connecting the Salvationist with the crime was overwhelmingly
convincing, and I had inextricably identified myself with the
Salvationist.&nbsp; And thus it comes to pass that in ten
minutes&rsquo; time I shall be hanged by the neck until I am dead
in expiation of the murder of myself, which murder never <!--
page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>took place, and of which, in any case, I am
innocent.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>When the Chaplain returned to his quarters some fifteen
minutes later, the black flag was floating over the prison
tower.&nbsp; Breakfast was waiting for him in the dining-room,
but he first passed into his library, and, taking up the
<i>Times</i> Atlas, consulted a map of the Balkan
Peninsula.&nbsp; &ldquo;A thing like that,&rdquo; he observed,
closing the volume with a snap, &ldquo;might happen to any
one.&rdquo;</p>

25</span>THE SEX THAT DOESN&rsquo;T SHOP</h2>
<p>The opening of a large new centre for West End shopping,
particularly feminine shopping, suggests the reflection, Do women
ever really shop?&nbsp; Of course, it is a well-attested fact
that they go forth shopping as assiduously as a bee goes
flower-visiting, but do they shop in the practical sense of the
word?&nbsp; Granted the money, time, and energy, a resolute
course of shopping transactions would naturally result in having
one&rsquo;s ordinary domestic needs unfailingly supplied, whereas
it is notorious that women servants (and housewives of all
classes) make it almost a point of honour not to be supplied with
everyday necessities.&nbsp; &ldquo;We shall be out of starch by
Thursday,&rdquo; they say with fatalistic foreboding, and by
Thursday they are out of starch.&nbsp; They have predicted almost
to a <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>minute the moment when their supply would give out and
if Thursday happens to be early closing day their triumph is
complete.&nbsp; A shop where starch is stored for retail purposes
possibly stands at their very door, but the feminine mind has
rejected such an obvious source for replenishing a dwindling
stock.&nbsp; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t deal there&rdquo; places it at
once beyond the pale of human resort.&nbsp; And it is noteworthy
that, just as a sheep-worrying dog seldom molests the flocks in
his near neighbourhood, so a woman rarely deals with shops in her
immediate vicinity.&nbsp; The more remote the source of supply
the more fixed seems to be the resolve to run short of the
commodity.&nbsp; The Ark had probably not quitted its last
moorings five minutes before some feminine voice gloatingly
recorded a shortage of bird-seed.&nbsp; A few days ago two lady
acquaintances of mine were confessing to some mental uneasiness
because a friend had called just before lunch-time, and they had
been unable to ask her to stop and share their meal, as (with a
touch of legitimate pride) &ldquo;there was nothing in the
house.&rdquo;&nbsp; I pointed out that they lived in a street
that bristled with provision shops and that it would have been
easy to mobilise a very <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>passable luncheon in less than five
minutes.&nbsp; &ldquo;That,&rdquo; they said with quiet dignity,
&ldquo;would not have occurred to us,&rdquo; and I felt that I
had suggested something bordering on the indecent.</p>
<p>But it is in catering for her literary wants that a
woman&rsquo;s shopping capacity breaks down most
completely.&nbsp; If you have perchance produced a book which has
met with some little measure of success, you are certain to get a
letter from some lady whom you scarcely known to bow to, asking
you &ldquo;how it can be got.&rdquo;&nbsp; She knows the name of
the book, its author, and who published it, but how to get into
actual contact with it is still an unsolved problem to her.&nbsp;
You write back pointing out that to have recourse to an
ironmonger or a corn-dealer will only entail delay and
disappointment, and suggest an application to a bookseller as the
most hopeful thing you can think of.&nbsp; In a day or two she
writes again: &ldquo;It is all right; I have borrowed it from
your aunt.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, of course, we have an example of
the Beyond-Shopper, one who has learned the Better Way, but the
helplessness exists even when such bypaths of relief are
closed.&nbsp; A lady who lives in the West End was expressing
<!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>to me the other day her interest in West Highland
terriers, and her desire to know more about the breed, so when, a
few days later, I came across an exhaustive article on that
subject in the current number of one of our best known
outdoor-life weeklies, I mentioned that circumstance in a letter,
giving the date of that number.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot get the
paper,&rdquo; was her telephoned response.&nbsp; And she
couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She lived in a city where newsagents are
numbered, I suppose, by the thousand, and she must have passed
dozens of such shops in her daily shopping excursions, but as far
as she was concerned that article on West Highland terriers might
as well have been written in a missal stored away in some
Buddhist monastery in Eastern Thibet.</p>
<p>The brutal directness of the masculine shopper arouses a
certain combative derision in the feminine onlooker.&nbsp; A cat
that spreads one shrew-mouse over the greater part of a long
summer afternoon, and then possibly loses him, doubtless feels
the same contempt for the terrier who compresses his rat into ten
seconds of the strenuous life.&nbsp; I was finishing off a short
list of purchases a few afternoons ago when I was discovered by a
<!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>lady of my acquaintance whom, swerving aside from the
lead given us by her godparents thirty years ago, we will call
Agatha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re surely not buying blotting-paper
<i>here</i>?&rdquo; she exclaimed in an agitated whisper, and she
seemed so genuinely concerned that I stayed my hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me take you to Winks and Pinks,&rdquo; she said as
soon as we were out of the building: &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve got
such lovely shades of blotting-paper&mdash;pearl and heliotrope
and <i>momie</i> and crushed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I want ordinary white blotting-paper,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind.&nbsp; They know me at Winks and
Pinks,&rdquo; she replied inconsequently.&nbsp; Agatha apparently
has an idea that blotting-paper is only sold in small quantities
to persons of known reputation, who may be trusted not to put it
to dangerous or improper uses.&nbsp; After walking some two
hundred yards she began to feel that her tea was of more
immediate importance than my blotting-paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want blotting-paper for?&rdquo; she asked
suddenly.&nbsp; I explained patiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I use it to dry up the ink of wet manuscript without
smudging the writing.&nbsp; <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Probably a
Chinese invention of the second century before Christ, but
I&rsquo;m not sure.&nbsp; The only other use for it that I can
think of is to roll it into a ball for a kitten to play
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t got a kitten,&rdquo; said Agatha,
with a feminine desire for stating the entire truth on most
occasions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stray one might come in at any moment,&rdquo; I
replied.</p>
<p>Anyway, I didn&rsquo;t get the blotting-paper.</p>

31</span>THE BLOOD-FEUD OF TOAD-WATER<br />
A WEST-COUNTRY EPIC</h2>
<p>The Cricks lived at Toad-Water; and in the same lonely upland
spot Fate had pitched the home of the Saunderses, and for miles
around these two dwellings there was never a neighbour or a
chimney or even a burying-ground to bring a sense of cheerful
communion or social intercourse.&nbsp; Nothing but fields and
spinneys and barns, lanes and waste-lands.&nbsp; Such was
Toad-Water; and, even so, Toad-Water had its history.</p>
<p>Thrust away in the benighted hinterland of a scattered market
district, it might have been supposed that these two detached
items of the Great Human Family would have leaned towards one
another in a fellowship begotten of kindred circumstances and a
common isolation from the outer world.&nbsp; <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>And perhaps
it had been so once, but the way of things had brought it
otherwise.&nbsp; Indeed, otherwise.&nbsp; Fate, which had linked
the two families in such unavoidable association of habitat, had
ordained that the Crick household should nourish and maintain
among its earthly possessions sundry head of domestic fowls,
while to the Saunderses was given a disposition towards the
cultivation of garden crops.&nbsp; Herein lay the material, ready
to hand, for the coming of feud and ill-blood.&nbsp; For the
grudge between the man of herbs and the man of live stock is no
new thing; you will find traces of it in the fourth chapter of
Genesis.&nbsp; And one sunny afternoon in late spring-time the
feud came&mdash;came, as such things mostly do come, with seeming
aimlessness and triviality.&nbsp; One of the Crick hens, in
obedience to the nomadic instincts of her kind, wearied of her
legitimate scratching-ground, and flew over the low wall that
divided the holdings of the neighbours.&nbsp; And there, on the
yonder side, with a hurried consciousness that her time and
opportunities might be limited, the misguided bird scratched and
scraped and beaked and delved in the soft yielding bed that had
been prepared for the solace and well-being of a colony of
seedling <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>onions.&nbsp; Little showers of
earth-mould and root-fibres went spraying before the hen and
behind her, and every minute the area of her operations
widened.&nbsp; The onions suffered considerably.&nbsp; Mrs.
Saunders, sauntering at this luckless moment down the garden
path, in order to fill her soul with reproaches at the iniquity
of the weeds, which grew faster than she or her good man cared to
remove them, stopped in mute discomfiture before the presence of
a more magnificent grievance.&nbsp; And then, in the hour of her
calamity, she turned instinctively to the Great Mother, and
gathered in her capacious hands large clods of the hard brown
soil that lay at her feet.&nbsp; With a terrible sincerity of
purpose, though with a contemptible inadequacy of aim, she rained
her earth bolts at the marauder, and the bursting pellets called
forth a flood of cackling protest and panic from the hastily
departing fowl.&nbsp; Calmness under misfortune is not an
attribute of either hen-folk or womenkind, and while Mrs.
Saunders declaimed over her onion bed such portions of the slang
dictionary as are permitted by the Nonconformist conscience to be
said or sung, the Vasco da Gama fowl was waking the echoes of
Toad-Water with crescendo bursts <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>of throat
music which compelled attention to her griefs.&nbsp; Mrs. Crick
had a long family, and was therefore licensed, in the eyes of her
world, to have a short temper, and when some of her ubiquitous
offspring had informed her, with the authority of eye-witnesses,
that her neighbour had so far forgotten herself as to heave
stones at her hen&mdash;her best hen, the best layer in the
countryside&mdash;her thoughts clothed themselves in language
&ldquo;unbecoming to a Christian woman&rdquo;&mdash;so at least
said Mrs. Saunders, to whom most of the language was
applied.&nbsp; Nor was she, on her part, surprised at Mrs.
Crick&rsquo;s conduct in letting her hens stray into other
body&rsquo;s gardens, and then abusing of them, seeing as how she
remembered things against Mrs. Crick&mdash;and the latter
simultaneously had recollections of lurking episodes in the past
of Susan Saunders that were nothing to her credit.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fond memory, when all things fade we fly to thee,&rdquo;
and in the paling light of an April afternoon the two women
confronted each other from their respective sides of the party
wall, recalling with shuddering breath the blots and blemishes of
their neighbour&rsquo;s family record.&nbsp; There was that aunt
of Mrs. Crick&rsquo;s who had died a pauper in Exeter
workhouse&mdash;<!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>every one knew that Mrs.
Saunders&rsquo; uncle on her mother&rsquo;s side drank himself to
death&mdash;then there was that Bristol cousin of Mrs.
Crick&rsquo;s!&nbsp; From the shrill triumph with which his name
was dragged in, his crime must have been pilfering from a
cathedral at least, but as both remembrancers were speaking at
once it was difficult to distinguish his infamy from the scandal
which beclouded the memory of Mrs. Saunders&rsquo;
brother&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s mother&mdash;who may have been a
regicide, and was certainly not a nice person as Mrs. Crick
painted her.&nbsp; And then, with an air of accumulating and
irresistible conviction, each belligerent informed the other that
she was no lady&mdash;after which they withdrew in a great
silence, feeling that nothing further remained to be said.&nbsp;
The chaffinches clinked in the apple trees and the bees droned
round the berberis bushes, and the waning sunlight slanted
pleasantly across the garden plots, but between the neighbour
households had sprung up a barrier of hate, permeating and
permanent.</p>
<p>The male heads of the families were necessarily drawn into the
quarrel, and the children on either side were forbidden to have
anything to do with the unhallowed <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>offspring of
the other party.&nbsp; As they had to travel a good three miles
along the same road to school every day, this was awkward, but
such things have to be.&nbsp; Thus all communication between the
households was sundered.&nbsp; Except the cats.&nbsp; Much as
Mrs. Saunders might deplore it, rumour persistently pointed to
the Crick he-cat as the presumable father of sundry kittens of
which the Saunders she-cat was indisputably the mother.&nbsp;
Mrs. Saunders drowned the kittens, but the disgrace remained.</p>
<p>Summer succeeded spring, and winter summer, but the feud
outlasted the waning seasons.&nbsp; Once, indeed, it seemed as
though the healing influences of religion might restore to
Toad-Water its erstwhile peace; the hostile families found
themselves side by side in the soul-kindling atmosphere of a
Revival Tea, where hymns were blended with a beverage that came
of tea-leaves and hot water and took after the latter parent, and
where ghostly counsel was tempered by garnishings of solidly
fashioned buns&mdash;and here, wrought up by the environment of
festive piety, Mrs. Saunders so far unbent as to remark guardedly
to Mrs. Crick that the evening had been a fine one.&nbsp; Mrs.
Crick, <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>under the influence of her ninth cup
of tea and her fourth hymn, ventured on the hope that it might
continue fine, but a maladroit allusion on the part of the
Saunders good man to the backwardness of garden crops brought the
Feud stalking forth from its corner with all its old
bitterness.&nbsp; Mrs. Saunders joined heartily in the singing of
the final hymn, which told of peace and joy and archangels and
golden glories; but her thoughts were dwelling on the pauper aunt
of Exeter.</p>
<p>Years have rolled away, and some of the actors in this wayside
drama have passed into the Unknown; other onions have arisen,
have flourished, have gone their way, and the offending hen has
long since expiated her misdeeds and lain with trussed feet and a
look of ineffable peace under the arched roof of Barnstaple
market.</p>
<p>But the Blood-feud of Toad-Water survives to this day.</p>

38</span>A YOUNG TURKISH CATASTROPHE<br />
IN TWO SCENES</h2>
<p>The Minister for Fine Arts (to whose Department had been
lately added the new sub-section of Electoral Engineering) paid a
business visit to the Grand Vizier.&nbsp; According to Eastern
etiquette they discoursed for a while on indifferent
subjects.&nbsp; The minister only checked himself in time from
making a passing reference to the Marathon Race, remembering that
the Vizier had a Persian grandmother and might consider any
allusion to Marathon as somewhat tactless.&nbsp; Presently the
Minister broached the subject of his interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the new Constitution are women to have
votes?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To have votes?&nbsp; Women?&rdquo; exclaimed the Vizier
in some astonishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear <!-- page 39--><a

New Departure has a flavour of the absurd as it is; don&rsquo;t
let&rsquo;s try and make it altogether ridiculous.&nbsp; Women
have no souls and no intelligence; why on earth should they have
votes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it sounds absurd,&rdquo; said the Minister,
&ldquo;but they are seriously considering the idea in the
West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they must have a larger equipment of seriousness
than I gave them credit for.&nbsp; After a lifetime of
specialised effort in maintaining my gravity I can scarcely
restrain an inclination to smile at the suggestion.&nbsp; Why,
out womenfolk in most cases don&rsquo;t know how to read or
write.&nbsp; How could they perform the operation of
voting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They could be shown the names of the candidates and
where to make their cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo; interrupted the Vizier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their crescent, I mean,&rdquo; corrected the
Minister.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be to the liking of the Young
Turkish Party,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said the Vizier, &ldquo;if we are to
do the thing at all we may as well go the whole h---&rdquo; he
pulled up just as he was uttering the name of an unclean animal,
and continued, &ldquo;the complete camel.&nbsp; I will issue <!--

<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The poll was drawing to a close in the Lakoumistan
division.&nbsp; The candidate of the Young Turkish Party was
known to be three or four hundred votes ahead, and he was already
drafting his address, returning thanks to the electors.&nbsp; His
victory had been almost a foregone conclusion, for he had set in
motion all the approved electioneering machinery of the
West.&nbsp; He had even employed motorcars.&nbsp; Few of his
supporters had gone to the poll in these vehicles, but, thanks to
the intelligent driving of his chauffeurs, many of his opponents
had gone to their graves or to the local hospitals, or otherwise
abstained from voting.&nbsp; And then something unlooked-for
happened.&nbsp; The rival candidate, Ali the Blest, arrived on
the scene with his wives and womenfolk, who numbered, roughly,
six hundred.&nbsp; Ali had wasted little effort on election
literature, but had been heard to remark that every vote given to
his opponent meant another sack thrown into the Bosphorus.&nbsp;
The Young Turkish candidate, who had conformed to the Western
custom of one wife and hardly any mistresses, stood by <!-- page
41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>helplessly while his adversary&rsquo;s poll swelled to a
triumphant majority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cristabel Columbus!&rdquo; he exclaimed, invoking in
some confusion the name of a distinguished pioneer; &ldquo;who
would have thought it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; mused Ali, &ldquo;that one who
harangued so clamorously about the Secret Ballot should have
overlooked the Veiled Vote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, walking homeward with his constituents, he murmured in
his beard an improvisation on the heretic poet of Persia:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One, rich in metaphors, his Cause
contrives<br />
To urge with edged words, like Kabul knives;<br />
And I, who worst him in this sorry game,<br />
Was never rich in anything but&mdash;wives.&rdquo;</p>

42</span>JUDKIN OF THE PARCELS</h2>
<p>A figure in an indefinite tweed suit, carrying brown-paper
parcels.&nbsp; That is what we met suddenly, at the bend of a
muddy Dorsetshire lane, and the roan mare stared and obviously
thought of a curtsey.&nbsp; The mare is road-shy, with intervals
of stolidity, and there is no telling what she will pass and what
she won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; We call her Redford.&nbsp; That was my
first meeting with Judkin, and the next time the circumstances
were the same; the same muddy lane, the same rather apologetic
figure in the tweed suit, the same&mdash;or very
similar&mdash;parcels.&nbsp; Only this time the roan looked
straight in front of her.</p>
<p>Whether I asked the groom or whether he advanced the
information, I forget; but someway I gradually reconstructed the
life-history of this trudger of the lanes.&nbsp; It was much the
same, no doubt, as that of many <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>others who
are from time to time pointed out to one as having been aforetime
in crack cavalry regiments and noted performers in the saddle;
men who have breathed into their lungs the wonder of the East,
have romped through life as through a cotillon, have had a thrust
perhaps at the Viceroy&rsquo;s Cup, and done fantastic
horsefleshy things around the Gulf of Aden.&nbsp; And then a
golden stream has dried up, the sunlight has faded suddenly out
of things, and the gods have nodded &ldquo;Go.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
they have not gone.&nbsp; They have turned instead to the muddy
lanes and cheap villas and the marked-down ills of life, to watch
pear trees growing and to encourage hens for their eggs.&nbsp;
And Judkin was even as these others; the wine had been suddenly
spilt from his cup of life, and he had stayed to suck at the
dregs which the wise throw away.&nbsp; In the days of his scorn
for most things he would have stared the roan mare and her
turn-out out of all pretension to smartness, as he would have
frozen a cheap claret behind its cork, or a plain woman behind
her veil; and now he was walking stoically through the mud, in a
tweed suit that would eventually go on to the gardener&rsquo;s
boy, and would perhaps fit him.&nbsp; The dear <!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>gods, who
know the end before the beginning, were perhaps growing a
gardener&rsquo;s boy somewhere to fit the garments, and Judkin
was only a caretaker, inhabiting a portion of them.&nbsp; That is
what I like to think, and I am probably wrong.&nbsp; And Judkin,
whose clothes had been to him once more than a religion, scarcely
less sacred than a family quarrel, would carry those parcels back
to his villa and to the wife who awaited him and them&mdash;a
wife who may, for all we know to the contrary, have had a figure
once, and perhaps has yet a heart of gold&mdash;of nine-carat
gold, let us say at the least&mdash;but assuredly a soul of
tape.&nbsp; And he that has fetched and carried will explain how
it has fared with him in his dealings, and if he has brought the
wrong sort of sugar or thread he will wheedle away the
displeasure from that leaden face as a pastrycook girl will drive
bluebottles off a stale bun.&nbsp; And that man has known what it
was to coax the fret of a thoroughbred, to soothe its toss and
sweat as it danced beneath him in the glee and chafe of its
pulses and the glory of its thews.&nbsp; He has been in the raw
places of the earth, where the desert beasts have whimpered their
unthinkable psalmody, and their eyes <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>have shone
back the reflex of the midnight stars&mdash;and he can immerse
himself in the tending of an incubator.&nbsp; It is horrible and
wrong, and yet when I have met him in the lanes his face has worn
a look of tedious cheerfulness that might pass for
happiness.&nbsp; Has Judkin of the Parcels found something in the
lees of life that I have missed in going to and fro over many
waters?&nbsp; Is there more wisdom in his perverseness than in
the madness of the wise?&nbsp; The dear gods know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I saw Judkin more than three times all
told, and always the lane was our point of contact; but as the
roan mare was taking me to the station one heavy, cloud-smeared
day, I passed a dull-looking villa that the groom, or instinct,
told me was Judkin&rsquo;s home.&nbsp; From beyond a hedge of
ragged elder-bushes could be heard the thud, thud of a spade,
with an occasional clink and pause, as if some one had picked out
a stone and thrown it to a distance, and I knew that <i>he</i>
was doing nameless things to the roots of a pear tree.&nbsp; Near
by him, I felt sure, would be lying a large and late vegetable
marrow, and its largeness and lateness would be a theme of
conversation at luncheon.&nbsp; It would be suggested that it
should grace the harvest <!-- page 46--><a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>thanksgiving
service; the harvest having been so generally unsatisfactory, it
would be unfair to let the farmers supply all the material for
rejoicing.</p>
<p>And while I was speeding townwards along the rails Judkin
would be plodding his way to the vicarage bearing a vegetable
marrow and a basketful of dahlias.&nbsp; The basket to be
returned.</p>

47</span>GABRIEL-ERNEST</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There is a wild beast in your woods,&rdquo; said the
artist Cunningham, as he was being driven to the station.&nbsp;
It was the only remark he had made during the drive, but as Van
Cheele had talked incessantly his companion&rsquo;s silence had
not been noticeable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stray fox or two and some resident weasels.&nbsp;
Nothing more formidable,&rdquo; said Van Cheele.&nbsp; The artist
said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you mean about a wild beast?&rdquo; said Van
Cheele later, when they were on the platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&nbsp; My imagination.&nbsp; Here is the
train,&rdquo; said Cunningham.</p>
<p>That afternoon Van Cheele went for one of his frequent rambles
through his woodland property.&nbsp; He had a stuffed bittern in
his study, and knew the names of quite a number of wild flowers,
so his aunt had <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>possibly some justification in
describing him as a great naturalist.&nbsp; At any rate, he was a
great walker.&nbsp; It was his custom to take mental notes of
everything he saw during his walks, not so much for the purpose
of assisting contemporary science as to provide topics for
conversation afterwards.&nbsp; When the bluebells began to show
themselves in flower he made a point of informing every one of
the fact; the season of the year might have warned his hearers of
the likelihood of such an occurrence, but at least they felt that
he was being absolutely frank with them.</p>
<p>What Van Cheele saw on this particular afternoon was, however,
something far removed from his ordinary range of
experience.&nbsp; On a shelf of smooth stone overhanging a deep
pool in the hollow of an oak coppice a boy of about sixteen lay
asprawl, drying his wet brown limbs luxuriously in the sun.&nbsp;
His wet hair, parted by a recent dive, lay close to his head, and
his light-brown eyes, so light that there was an almost tigerish
gleam in them, were turned towards Van Cheele with a certain lazy
watchfulness.&nbsp; It was an unexpected apparition, and Van
Cheele found himself engaged in the novel process of thinking
before he spoke.&nbsp; Where on earth <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>could this
wild-looking boy hail from?&nbsp; The miller&rsquo;s wife had
lost a child some two months ago, supposed to have been swept
away by the mill-race, but that had been a mere baby, not a
half-grown lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing there?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously, sunning myself,&rdquo; replied the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, in these woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t live in the woods,&rdquo; said Van
Cheele.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are very nice woods,&rdquo; said the boy, with a
touch of patronage in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where do you sleep at night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t sleep at night; that&rsquo;s my busiest
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Cheele began to have an irritated feeling that he was
grappling with a problem that was eluding him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you feed on?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flesh,&rdquo; said the boy, and he pronounced the word
with slow relish, as though he were tasting it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flesh!&nbsp; What Flesh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since it interests you, rabbits, wild-fowl, hares,
poultry, lambs in their season, children <!-- page 50--><a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>when I can
get any; they&rsquo;re usually too well locked in at night, when
I do most of my hunting.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s quite two months since
I tasted child-flesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ignoring the chaffing nature of the last remark Van Cheele
tried to draw the boy on the subject of possible poaching
operations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking rather through your hat when you
speak of feeding on hares.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Considering the nature
of the boy&rsquo;s toilet the simile was hardly an apt
one.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Our hillside hares aren&rsquo;t easily
caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At night I hunt on four feet,&rdquo; was the somewhat
cryptic response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you mean that you hunt with a dog?&rdquo;
hazarded Van Cheele.</p>
<p>The boy rolled slowly over on to his back, and laughed a weird
low laugh, that was pleasantly like a chuckle and disagreeably
like a snarl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fancy any dog would be very anxious for
my company, especially at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Cheele began to feel that there was something positively
uncanny about the strange-eyed, strange-tongued youngster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have you staying in these woods,&rdquo;
he declared authoritatively.</p>
<p><!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>&ldquo;I fancy you&rsquo;d rather have me here than in
your house,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>The prospect of this wild, nude animal in Van Cheele&rsquo;s
primly ordered house was certainly an alarming one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t go.&nbsp; I shall have to make
you,&rdquo; said Van Cheele.</p>
<p>The boy turned like a flash, plunged into the pool, and in a
moment had flung his wet and glistening body half-way up the bank
where Van Cheele was standing.&nbsp; In an otter the movement
would not have been remarkable; in a boy Van Cheele found it
sufficiently startling.&nbsp; His foot slipped as he made an
involuntarily backward movement, and he found himself almost
prostrate on the slippery weed-grown bank, with those tigerish
yellow eyes not very far from his own.&nbsp; Almost instinctively
he half raised his hand to his throat.&nbsp; They boy laughed
again, a laugh in which the snarl had nearly driven out the
chuckle, and then, with another of his astonishing lightning
movements, plunged out of view into a yielding tangle of weed and
fern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an extraordinary wild animal!&rdquo; said Van
Cheele as he picked himself up.&nbsp; And then he recalled
Cunningham&rsquo;s remark &ldquo;There is a wild beast in your
woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>Walking slowly homeward, Van Cheele began to turn over
in his mind various local occurrences which might be traceable to
the existence of this astonishing young savage.</p>
<p>Something had been thinning the game in the woods lately,
poultry had been missing from the farms, hares were growing
unaccountably scarcer, and complaints had reached him of lambs
being carried off bodily from the hills.&nbsp; Was it possible
that this wild boy was really hunting the countryside in company
with some clever poacher dogs?&nbsp; He had spoken of hunting
&ldquo;four-footed&rdquo; by night, but then, again, he had
hinted strangely at no dog caring to come near him,
&ldquo;especially at night.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was certainly
puzzling.&nbsp; And then, as Van Cheele ran his mind over the
various depredations that had been committed during the last
month or two, he came suddenly to a dead stop, alike in his walk
and his speculations.&nbsp; The child missing from the mill two
months ago&mdash;the accepted theory was that it had tumbled into
the mill-race and been swept away; but the mother had always
declared she had heard a shriek on the hill side of the house, in
the opposite direction from the water.&nbsp; It was unthinkable,
of course, but he wished that the boy <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>had not made
that uncanny remark about child-flesh eaten two months ago.&nbsp;
Such dreadful things should not be said even in fun.</p>
<p>Van Cheele, contrary to his usual wont, did not feel disposed
to be communicative about his discovery in the wood.&nbsp; His
position as a parish councillor and justice of the peace seemed
somehow compromised by the fact that he was harbouring a
personality of such doubtful repute on his property; there was
even a possibility that a heavy bill of damages for raided lambs
and poultry might be laid at his door.&nbsp; At dinner that night
he was quite unusually silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your voice gone to?&rdquo; said his
aunt.&nbsp; &ldquo;One would think you had seen a
wolf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Cheele, who was not familiar with the old saying, thought
the remark rather foolish; if he <i>had</i> seen a wolf on his
property his tongue would have been extraordinarily busy with the
subject.</p>
<p>At breakfast next morning Van Cheele was conscious that his
feeling of uneasiness regarding yesterday&rsquo;s episode had not
wholly disappeared, and he resolved to go by train to the
neighbouring cathedral town, hunt up <!-- page 54--><a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>Cunningham,
and learn from him what he had really seen that had prompted the
remark about a wild beast in the woods.&nbsp; With this
resolution taken, his usual cheerfulness partially returned, and
he hummed a bright little melody as he sauntered to the
morning-room for his customary cigarette.&nbsp; As he entered the
room the melody made way abruptly for a pious invocation.&nbsp;
Gracefully asprawl on the ottoman, in an attitude of almost
exaggerated repose, was the boy of the woods.&nbsp; He was drier
than when Van Cheele had last seen him, but no other alteration
was noticeable in his toilet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you come here?&rdquo; asked Van Cheele
furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me I was not to stay in the woods,&rdquo; said
the boy calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not to come here.&nbsp; Supposing my aunt should
see you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with a view to minimising that catastrophe, Van Cheele
hastily obscured as much of his unwelcome guest as possible under
the folds of a <i>Morning Post</i>.&nbsp; At that moment his aunt
entered the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a poor boy who has lost his way&mdash;and lost
his memory.&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t know who he is or where he
comes from,&rdquo; explained Van <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>Cheele
desperately, glancing apprehensively at the waif&rsquo;s face to
see whether he was going to add inconvenient candour to his other
savage propensities.</p>
<p>Miss Van Cheele was enormously interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps his underlinen is marked,&rdquo; she
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to have lost most of that, too,&rdquo; said
Van Cheele, making frantic little grabs at the <i>Morning
Post</i> to keep it in its place.</p>
<p>A naked homeless child appealed to Miss Van Cheele as warmly
as a stray kitten or derelict puppy would have done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must do all we can for him,&rdquo; she decided, and
in a very short time a messenger, dispatched to the rectory,
where a page-boy was kept, had returned with a suit of pantry
clothes, and the necessary accessories of shirt, shoes, collar,
etc.&nbsp; Clothed, clean, and groomed, the boy lost none of his
uncanniness in Van Cheele&rsquo;s eyes, but his aunt found him
sweet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must call him something till we know who he really
is,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gabriel-Ernest, I think; those
are nice suitable names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Cheele agreed, but he privately doubted whether they were
being grafted on to a nice suitable child.&nbsp; His misgivings
were <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>not diminished by the fact that his staid and elderly
spaniel had bolted out of the house at the first incoming of the
boy, and now obstinately remained shivering and yapping at the
farther end of the orchard, while the canary, usually as vocally
industrious as Van Cheele himself, had put itself on an allowance
of frightened cheeps.&nbsp; More than ever he was resolved to
consult Cunningham without loss of time.</p>
<p>As he drove off to the station his aunt was arranging that
Gabriel-Ernest should help her to entertain the infant members of
her Sunday-school class at tea that afternoon.</p>
<p>Cunningham was not at first disposed to be communicative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother died of some brain trouble,&rdquo; he
explained, &ldquo;so you will understand why I am averse to
dwelling on anything of an impossibly fantastic nature that I may
see or think that I have seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what <i>did</i> you see?&rdquo; persisted Van
Cheele.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I thought I saw was something so extraordinary
that no really sane man could dignify it with the credit of
having actually happened.&nbsp; I was standing, the last evening
I was with you, half-hidden in the hedge-growth <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>by the
orchard gate, watching the dying glow of the sunset.&nbsp;
Suddenly I became aware of a naked boy, a bather from some
neighbouring pool, I took him to be, who was standing out on the
bare hillside also watching the sunset.&nbsp; His pose was so
suggestive of some wild faun of Pagan myth that I instantly
wanted to engage him as a model, and in another moment I think I
should have hailed him.&nbsp; But just then the sun dipped out of
view, and all the orange and pink slid out of the landscape,
leaving it cold and grey.&nbsp; And at the same moment an
astounding thing happened&mdash;the boy vanished too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! vanished away into nothing?&rdquo; asked Van
Cheele excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; that is the dreadful part of it,&rdquo; answered
the artist; &ldquo;on the open hillside where the boy had been
standing a second ago, stood a large wolf, blackish in colour,
with gleaming fangs and cruel, yellow eyes.&nbsp; You may
think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Van Cheele did not stop for anything as futile as
thought.&nbsp; Already he was tearing at top speed towards the
station.&nbsp; He dismissed the idea of a telegram.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gabriel-Ernest is a werewolf&rdquo; was a hopelessly <!--
page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>inadequate effort at conveying the situation, and his
aunt would think it was a code message to which he had omitted to
give her the key.&nbsp; His one hope was that he might reach home
before sundown.&nbsp; The cab which he chartered at the other end
of the railway journey bore him with what seemed exasperating
slowness along the country roads, which were pink and mauve with
the flush of the sinking sun.&nbsp; His aunt was putting away
some unfinished jams and cake when he arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Gabriel-Ernest?&rdquo; he almost screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is taking the little Toop child home,&rdquo; said
his aunt.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was getting so late, I thought it
wasn&rsquo;t safe to let it go back alone.&nbsp; What a lovely
sunset, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Van Cheele, although not oblivious of the glow in the
western sky, did not stay to discuss its beauties.&nbsp; At a
speed for which he was scarcely geared he raced along the narrow
lane that led to the home of the Toops.&nbsp; On one side ran the
swift current of the mill-stream, on the other rose the stretch
of bare hillside.&nbsp; A dwindling rim of red sun showed still
on the skyline, and the next turning must bring him in view of
the ill-assorted <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>couple he was pursuing.&nbsp; Then
the colour went suddenly out of things, and a grey light settled
itself with a quick shiver over the landscape.&nbsp; Van Cheele
heard a shrill wail of fear, and stopped running.</p>
<p>Nothing was ever seen again of the Toop child or
Gabriel-Ernest, but the latter&rsquo;s discarded garments were
found lying in the road so it was assumed that the child had
fallen into the water, and that the boy had stripped and jumped
in, in a vain endeavour to save it.&nbsp; Van Cheele and some
workmen who were near by at the time testified to having heard a
child scream loudly just near the spot where the clothes were
found.&nbsp; Mrs. Toop, who had eleven other children, was
decently resigned to her bereavement, but Miss Van Cheele
sincerely mourned her lost foundling.&nbsp; It was on her
initiative that a memorial brass was put up in the parish church
to &ldquo;Gabriel-Ernest, an unknown boy, who bravely sacrificed
his life for another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Cheele gave way to his aunt in most things, but he flatly
refused to subscribe to the Gabriel-Ernest memorial.</p>
<h2><!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>THE SAINT AND THE GOBLIN</h2>
<p>The little stone Saint occupied a retired niche in a side
aisle of the old cathedral.&nbsp; No one quite remembered who he
had been, but that in a way was a guarantee of
respectability.&nbsp; At least so the Goblin said.&nbsp; The
Goblin was a very fine specimen of quaint stone carving, and
lived up in the corbel on the wall opposite the niche of the
little Saint.&nbsp; He was connected with some of the best
cathedral folk, such as the queer carvings in the choir stalls
and chancel screen, and even the gargoyles high up on the
roof.&nbsp; All the fantastic beasts and manikins that sprawled
and twisted in wood or stone or lead overhead in the arches or
away down in the crypt were in some way akin to him; consequently
he was a person of recognised importance in the cathedral
world.</p>
<p>The little stone Saint and the Goblin got <!-- page 61--><a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>on very well
together, though they looked at most things from different points
of view.&nbsp; The Saint was a philanthropist in an old fashioned
way; he thought the world, as he saw it, was good, but might be
improved.&nbsp; In particular he pitied the church mice, who were
miserably poor.&nbsp; The Goblin, on the other hand, was of
opinion that the world, as he knew it, was bad, but had better be
let alone.&nbsp; It was the function of the church mice to be
poor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; said the Saint, &ldquo;I feel very
sorry for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you do,&rdquo; said the Goblin;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s <i>your</i> function to feel sorry for
them.&nbsp; If they were to leave off being poor you
couldn&rsquo;t fulfil your functions.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d be a
sinecure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rather hoped that the Saint would ask him what a sinecure
meant, but the latter took refuge in a stony silence.&nbsp; The
Goblin might be right, but still, he thought, he would like to do
something for the church mice before winter came on; they were so
very poor.</p>
<p>Whilst he was thinking the matter over he was startled by
something falling between his feet with a hard metallic
clatter.&nbsp; It was a <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>bright new thaler; one of the
cathedral jackdaws, who collected such things, had flown in with
it to a stone cornice just above his niche, and the banging of
the sacristy door had startled him into dropping it.&nbsp; Since
the invention of gunpowder the family nerves were not what they
had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you got there?&rdquo; asked the Goblin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A silver thaler,&rdquo; said the Saint.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;it is most fortunate;
now I can do something for the church mice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will you manage it?&rdquo; asked the Goblin.</p>
<p>The Saint considered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will appear in a vision to the vergeress who sweeps
the floors.&nbsp; I will tell her that she will find a silver
thaler between my feet, and that she must take it and buy a
measure of corn and put it on my shrine.&nbsp; When she finds the
money she will know that it was a true dream, and she will take
care to follow my directions.&nbsp; Then the mice will have food
all the winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course <i>you</i> can do that,&rdquo; observed the
Goblin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, <i>I</i> can only appear to people
after they have had a heavy supper of indigestible things.&nbsp;
My opportunities with the <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>vergeress
would be limited.&nbsp; There is some advantage in being a saint
after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this while the coin was lying at the Saint&rsquo;s
feet.&nbsp; It was clean and glittering and had the
Elector&rsquo;s arms beautifully stamped upon it.&nbsp; The Saint
began to reflect that such an opportunity was too rare to be
hastily disposed of.&nbsp; Perhaps indiscriminate charity might
be harmful to the church mice.&nbsp; After all, it was their
function to be poor; the Goblin had said so, and the Goblin was
generally right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking,&rdquo; he said to that
personage, &ldquo;that perhaps it would be really better if I
ordered a thaler&rsquo;s worth of candles to be placed on my
shrine instead of the corn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He often wished, for the look of the thing, that people would
sometimes burn candles at his shrine; but as they had forgotten
who he was it was not considered a profitable speculation to pay
him that attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Candles would be more orthodox,&rdquo; said the
Goblin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More orthodox, certainly,&rdquo; agreed the Saint,
&ldquo;and the mice could have the ends to eat; candle-ends are
most fattening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Goblin was too well bred to wink; <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>besides,
being a stone goblin, it was out of the question.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it ain&rsquo;t there, sure enough!&rdquo; said
the vergeress next morning.&nbsp; She took the shining coin down
from the dusty niche and turned it over and over in her grimy
hands.&nbsp; Then she put it to her mouth and bit it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t be going to eat it,&rdquo; thought the
Saint, and fixed her with his stoniest stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the woman, in a somewhat shriller
key, &ldquo;who&rsquo;d have thought it!&nbsp; A saint,
too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she did an unaccountable thing.&nbsp; She hunted an old
piece of tape out of her pocket, and tied to crosswise, with a
big loop, round the thaler, and hung it round the neck of the
little Saint.</p>
<p>Then she went away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only possible explanation,&rdquo; said the Goblin,
&ldquo;is that it&rsquo;s a bad one.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that decoration your neighbour is
wearing?&rdquo; asked a wyvern that was wrought into the capital
of an adjacent pillar.</p>
<p><!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>The Saint was ready to cry with mortification, only,
being of stone, he couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a coin of&mdash;ahem!&mdash;fabulous
value,&rdquo; replied the Goblin tactfully.</p>
<p>And the news went round the Cathedral that the shrine of the
little stone Saint had been enriched by a priceless offering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, it&rsquo;s something to have the conscience
of a goblin,&rdquo; said the Saint to himself.</p>
<p>The church mice were as poor as ever.&nbsp; But that was their
function.</p>

66</span>THE SOUL OF LAPLOSHKA</h2>
<p>Laploshka was one of the meanest men I have ever met, and
quite one of the most entertaining.&nbsp; He said horrid things
about other people in such a charming way that one forgave him
for the equally horrid things he said about oneself behind
one&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; Hating anything in the way of ill-natured
gossip ourselves, we are always grateful to those who do it for
us and do it well.&nbsp; And Laploshka did it really well.</p>
<p>Naturally Laploshka had a large circle of acquaintances, and
as he exercised some care in their selection it followed that an
appreciable proportion were men whose bank balances enabled them
to acquiesce indulgently in his rather one-sided views on
hospitality.&nbsp; Thus, although possessed of only moderate
means, he was able to live comfortably within his income, and
still more comfortably within those of various tolerantly
disposed associates.</p>
<p><!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>But towards the poor or to those of the same limited
resources as himself his attitude was one of watchful anxiety; he
seemed to be haunted by a besetting fear lest some fraction of a
shilling or franc, or whatever the prevailing coinage might be,
should be diverted from his pocket or service into that of a
hard-up companion.&nbsp; A two-franc cigar would be cheerfully
offered to a wealthy patron, on the principle of doing evil that
good may come, but I have known him indulge in agonies of perjury
rather than admit the incriminating possession of a copper coin
when change was needed to tip a waiter.&nbsp; The coin would have
been duly returned at the earliest opportunity&mdash;he would
have taken means to insure against forgetfulness on the part of
the borrower&mdash;but accidents might happen, and even the
temporary estrangement from his penny or sou was a calamity to be
avoided.</p>
<p>The knowledge of this amiable weakness offered a perpetual
temptation to play upon Laploshka&rsquo;s fears of involuntary
generosity.&nbsp; To offer him a lift in a cab and pretend not to
have enough money to pay the fair, to fluster him with a request
for a sixpence when his hand was full of silver just received in
<!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>change, these were a few of the petty torments that
ingenuity prompted as occasion afforded.&nbsp; To do justice to
Laploshka&rsquo;s resourcefulness it must be admitted that he
always emerged somehow or other from the most embarrassing
dilemma without in any way compromising his reputation for saying
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the gods send opportunities at some
time to most men, and mine came one evening when Laploshka and I
were supping together in a cheap boulevard restaurant.&nbsp;
(Except when he was the bidden guest of some one with an
irreproachable income, Laploshka was wont to curb his appetite
for high living; on such fortunate occasions he let it go on an
easy snaffle.)&nbsp; At the conclusion of the meal a somewhat
urgent message called me away, and without heeding my
companion&rsquo;s agitated protest, I called back cruelly,
&ldquo;Pay my share; I&rsquo;ll settle with you
to-morrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Early on the morrow Laploshka hunted me
down by instinct as I walked along a side street that I hardly
ever frequented.&nbsp; He had the air of a man who had not
slept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You owe me two francs from last night,&rdquo; was his
breathless greeting.</p>
<p>I spoke evasively of the situation in Portugal, where more
trouble seemed brewing.&nbsp; But <!-- page 69--><a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>Laploshka
listened with the abstraction of the deaf adder, and quickly
returned to the subject of the two francs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I must owe it to you,&rdquo; I said
lightly and brutally.&nbsp; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a sou in the
world,&rdquo; and I added mendaciously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
away for six months or perhaps longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laploshka said nothing, but his eyes bulged a little and his
cheeks took on the mottled hues of an ethnographical map of the
Balkan Peninsula.&nbsp; That same day, at sundown, he died.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Failure of the heart&rsquo;s action,&rdquo; was the
doctor&rsquo;s verdict; but I, who knew better, knew that he died
of grief.</p>
<p>There arose the problem of what to do with his two
francs.&nbsp; To have killed Laploshka was one thing; to have
kept his beloved money would have argued a callousness of feeling
of which I am not capable.&nbsp; The ordinary solution, of giving
it to the poor, would by no means fit the present situation, for
nothing would have distressed the dead man more than such a
misuse of his property.&nbsp; On the other hand, the bestowal of
two francs on the rich was an operation which called for some
tact.&nbsp; An easy way out of the difficulty seemed, however, to
present itself the following <!-- page 70--><a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>Sunday, as I
was wedged into the cosmopolitan crowd which filled the
side-aisle of one of the most popular Paris churches.&nbsp; A
collecting-bag, for &ldquo;the poor of Monsieur le
Cur&eacute;,&rdquo; was buffeting its tortuous way across the
seemingly impenetrable human sea, and a German in front of me,
who evidently did not wish his appreciation of the magnificent
music to be marred by a suggestion of payment, made audible
criticisms to his companion on the claims of the said
charity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do not want money,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;they
have too much money.&nbsp; They have no poor.&nbsp; They are all
pampered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If that were really the case my way seemed clear.&nbsp; I
dropped Laploshka&rsquo;s two francs into the bag with a murmured
blessing on the rich of Monsieur le Cur&eacute;.</p>
<p>Some three weeks later chance had taken me to Vienna, and I
sat one evening regaling myself in a humble but excellent little
Gasthaus up in the Wahringer quarter.&nbsp; The appointments were
primitive, but the Schnitzel, the beer, and the cheese could not
have been improved on.&nbsp; Good cheer brought good custom, and
with the exception of one small table near the door every place
was occupied.&nbsp; Half-way through my meal I happened to <!--
page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>glance in the direction of that empty seat, and saw that
it was no longer empty.&nbsp; Poring over the bill of fare with
the absorbed scrutiny of one who seeks the cheapest among the
cheap was Laploshka.&nbsp; Once he looked across at me, with a
comprehensive glance at my repast, as though to say, &ldquo;It is
my two francs you are eating,&rdquo; and then looked swiftly
away.&nbsp; Evidently the poor of Monsieur le Cur&eacute; had
been genuine poor.&nbsp; The Schnitzel turned to leather in my
mouth, the beer seemed tepid; I left the Emmenthaler
untasted.&nbsp; My one idea was to get away from the room, away
from the table where <i>that</i> was seated; and as I fled I felt
Laploshka&rsquo;s reproachful eyes watching the amount that I
gave to the piccolo&mdash;out of his two francs.&nbsp; I lunched
next day at an expensive restaurant which I felt sure that the
living Laploshka would never have entered on his own account, and
I hoped that the dead Laploshka would observe the same
barriers.&nbsp; I was not mistaken, but as I came out I found him
miserably studying the bill of fare stuck up on the
portals.&nbsp; Then he slowly made his way over to a
milk-hall.&nbsp; For the first time in my experience I missed the
charm and gaiety of Vienna life.</p>
<p>After that, in Paris or London or wherever <!-- page 72--><a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>I happened to
be, I continued to see a good deal of Laploshka.&nbsp; If I had a
seat in a box at a theatre I was always conscious of his eyes
furtively watching me from the dim recesses of the gallery.&nbsp;
As I turned into my club on a rainy afternoon I would see him
taking inadequate shelter in a doorway opposite.&nbsp; Even if I
indulged in the modest luxury of a penny chair in the Park he
generally confronted me from one of the free benches, never
staring at me, but always elaborately conscious of my
presence.&nbsp; My friends began to comment on my changed looks,
and advised me to leave off heaps of things.&nbsp; I should have
liked to have left off Laploshka.</p>
<p>On a certain Sunday&mdash;it was probably Easter, for the
crush was worse than ever&mdash;I was again wedged into the crowd
listening to the music in the fashionable Paris church, and again
the collection-bag was buffeting its way across the human
sea.&nbsp; An English lady behind me was making ineffectual
efforts to convey a coin into the still distant bag, so I took
the money at her request and helped it forward to its
destination.&nbsp; It was a two-franc piece.&nbsp; A swift
inspiration came to me, and I merely dropped my own sou into the
bag and slid the silver coin into my pocket.&nbsp; I had
withdrawn <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Laploshka&rsquo;s two francs from the
poor, who should never have had the legacy.&nbsp; As I backed
away from the crowd I heard a woman&rsquo;s voice say, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe he put my money in the bag.&nbsp; There are
swarms of people in Paris like that!&rdquo;&nbsp; But my mind was
lighter that it had been for a long time.</p>
<p>The delicate mission of bestowing the retrieved sum on the
deserving rich still confronted me.&nbsp; Again I trusted to the
inspiration of accident, and again fortune favoured me.&nbsp; A
shower drove me, two days later, into one of the historic
churches on the left bank of the Seine, and there I found,
peering at the old wood-carvings, the Baron R., one of the
wealthiest and most shabbily dressed men in Paris.&nbsp; It was
now or never.&nbsp; Putting a strong American inflection into the
French which I usually talked with an unmistakable British
accent, I catechised the Baron as to the date of the
church&rsquo;s building, its dimensions, and other details which
an American tourist would be certain to want to know.&nbsp;
Having acquired such information as the Baron was able to impart
on short notice, I solemnly placed the two-franc piece in his
hand, with the hearty assurance that it was &ldquo;pour
vous,&rdquo; and turned to go.&nbsp; The Baron was slightly <!--
page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>taken aback, but accepted the situation with a good
grace.&nbsp; Walking over to a small box fixed in the wall, he
dropped Laploshka&rsquo;s two francs into the slot.&nbsp; Over
the box was the inscription, &ldquo;Pour les pauvres de M. le
Cur&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening, at the crowded corner by the Cafe de la Paix, I
caught a fleeting glimpse of Laploshka.&nbsp; He smiled, slightly
raised his hat, and vanished.&nbsp; I never saw him again.&nbsp;
After all, the money had been <i>given</i> to the deserving rich,
and the soul of Laploshka was at peace.</p>

75</span>THE BAG</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The Major is coming in to tea,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Hoopington to her niece.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just gone round
to the stables with his horse.&nbsp; Be as bright and lively as
you can; the poor man&rsquo;s got a fit of the glooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Major Pallaby was a victim of circumstances, over which he had
no control, and of his temper, over which he had very
little.&nbsp; He had taken on the Mastership of the Pexdale
Hounds in succession to a highly popular man who had fallen foul
of his committee, and the Major found himself confronted with the
overt hostility of at least half the hunt, while his lack of tact
and amiability had done much to alienate the remainder.&nbsp;
Hence subscriptions were beginning to fall off, foxes grew
provokingly scarcer, and wire obtruded itself with increasing
frequency.&nbsp; The Major could plead reasonable excuse for his
fit of the glooms.</p>
<p><!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>In ranging herself as a partisan on the side of Major
Pallaby Mrs. Hoopington had been largely influenced by the fact
that she had made up her mind to marry him at an early
date.&nbsp; Against his notorious bad temper she set his three
thousand a year, and his prospective succession to a baronetcy
gave a casting vote in his favour.&nbsp; The Major&rsquo;s plans
on the subject of matrimony were not at present in such an
advanced stage as Mrs. Hoopington&rsquo;s, but he was beginning
to find his way over to Hoopington Hall with a frequency that was
already being commented on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had a wretchedly thin field out again
yesterday,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hoopington.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why you
didn&rsquo;t bring one or two hunting men down with you, instead
of that stupid Russian boy, I can&rsquo;t think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vladimir isn&rsquo;t stupid,&rdquo; protested her
niece; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s one of the most amusing boys I ever
met.&nbsp; Just compare him for a moment with some of your heavy
hunting men&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, my dear Norah, he can&rsquo;t ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Russians never can; but he shoots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and what does he shoot?&nbsp; Yesterday he brought
home a woodpecker in his game-bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;d shot three pheasants and some
rabbits as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no excuse for including a woodpecker in
his game-bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foreigners go in for mixed bags more than we do.&nbsp;
A Grand Duke pots a vulture just as seriously as we should stalk
a bustard.&nbsp; Anyhow, I&rsquo;ve explained to Vladimir that
certain birds are beneath his dignity as a sportsman.&nbsp; And
as he&rsquo;s only nineteen, of course, his dignity is a sure
thing to appeal to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hoopington sniffed.&nbsp; Most people with whom Vladimir
came in contact found his high spirits infectious, but his
present hostess was guaranteed immune against infection of that
sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear him coming in now,&rdquo; she observed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I shall go and get ready for tea.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re going
to have it here in the hall.&nbsp; Entertain the Major if he
comes in before I&rsquo;m down, and, above all, be
bright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah was dependent on her aunt&rsquo;s good graces for many
little things that made life worth living, and she was conscious
of a feeling of discomfiture because the Russian youth whom she
had brought down as a welcome element of change in the
country-house <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>routine was not making a good
impression.&nbsp; That young gentleman, however, was supremely
unconscious of any shortcomings, and burst into the hall, tired,
and less sprucely groomed than usual, but distinctly
radiant.&nbsp; His game-bag looked comfortably full.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess what I have shot,&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pheasants, woodpigeons, rabbits,&rdquo; hazarded
Norah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; a large beast; I don&rsquo;t know what you call it
in English.&nbsp; Brown, with a darkish tail.&rdquo;&nbsp; Norah
changed colour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it live in a tree and eat nuts?&rdquo; she asked,
hoping that the use of the adjective &ldquo;large&rdquo; might be
an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Vladimir laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no; not a <i>biyelka</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it swim and eat fish?&rdquo; asked Norah, with a
fervent prayer in her heart that it might turn out to be an
otter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Vladimir, busy with the straps of his
game-bag; &ldquo;it lives in the woods, and eats rabbits and
chickens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah sat down suddenly, and hid her face in her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merciful Heaven!&rdquo; she wailed; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
shot a fox!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>Vladimir looked up at her in consternation.&nbsp; In a
torrent of agitated words she tried to explain the horror of the
situation.&nbsp; The boy understood nothing, but was thoroughly
alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hide it, hide it!&rdquo; said Norah frantically,
pointing to the still unopened bag.&nbsp; &ldquo;My aunt and the
Major will be here in a moment.&nbsp; Throw it on the top of that
chest; they won&rsquo;t see it there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vladimir swung the bag with fair aim; but the strap caught in
its flight on the outstanding point of an antler fixed in the
wall, and the bag, with its terrible burden, remained suspended
just above the alcove where tea would presently be laid.&nbsp; At
that moment Mrs. Hoopington and the Major entered the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Major is going to draw our covers to-morrow,&rdquo;
announced the lady, with a certain heavy satisfaction.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Smithers is confident that we&rsquo;ll be able to show him
some sport; he swears he&rsquo;s seen a fox in the nut copse
three times this week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I hope so; I hope so,&rdquo; said the
Major moodily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must break this sequence of blank
days.&nbsp; One hears so often that a fox has settled down as a
tenant for life in certain <!-- page 80--><a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>covers, and
then when you go to turn him out there isn&rsquo;t a trace of
him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m certain a fox was shot or trapped in Lady
Widden&rsquo;s woods the very day before we drew them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major, if any one tried that game on in my woods
they&rsquo;d get short shrift,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hoopington.</p>
<p>Norah found her way mechanically to the tea-table and made her
fingers frantically busy in rearranging the parsley round the
sandwich dish.&nbsp; On one side of her loomed the morose
countenance of the Major, on the other she was conscious of the
scared, miserable eyes of Vladimir.&nbsp; And above it all hung
<i>that</i>.&nbsp; She dared not raise her eyes above the level
of the tea-table, and she almost expected to see a spot of
accusing vulpine blood drip down and stain the whiteness of the
cloth.&nbsp; Her aunt&rsquo;s manner signalled to her the
repeated message to &ldquo;be bright&rdquo;; for the present she
was fully occupied in keeping her teeth from chattering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you shoot to-day?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Hoopington
suddenly of the unusually silent Vladimir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;nothing worth speaking of,&rdquo; said
the boy.</p>
<p>Norah&rsquo;s heart, which had stood still for a <!-- page
81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>space, made up for lost time with a most disturbing
bound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d find something that was worth
speaking about,&rdquo; said the hostess; &ldquo;every one seems
to have lost their tongues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did Smithers last see that fox?&rdquo; said the
Major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday morning; a fine dog-fox, with a dark
brush,&rdquo; confided Mrs. Hoopington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha, we&rsquo;ll have a good gallop after that brush
to-morrow,&rdquo; said the Major, with a transient gleam of good
humour.&nbsp; And then gloomy silence settled again round the
tea-table, a silence broken only by despondent munchings and the
occasional feverish rattle of a teaspoon in its saucer.&nbsp; A
diversion was at last afforded by Mrs. Hoopington&rsquo;s
fox-terrier, which had jumped on to a vacant chair, the better to
survey the delicacies of the table, and was now sniffing in an
upward direction at something apparently more interesting than
cold tea-cake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is exciting him?&rdquo; asked his mistress, as the
dog suddenly broke into short angry barks, with a running
accompaniment of tremulous whines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s your
game-bag, Vladimir!&nbsp; What <i>have</i> you got in
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>&ldquo;By Gad,&rdquo; said the Major, who was now
standing up; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a pretty warm scent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then a simultaneous idea flashed on himself and Mrs.
Hoopington.&nbsp; Their faces flushed to distinct but harmonious
tones of purple, and with one accusing voice they screamed,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve shot the fox!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah tried hastily to palliate Vladimir&rsquo;s misdeed in
their eyes, but it is doubtful whether they heard her.&nbsp; The
Major&rsquo;s fury clothed and reclothed itself in words as
frantically as a woman up in town for one day&rsquo;s shopping
tries on a succession of garments.&nbsp; He reviled and railed at
fate and the general scheme of things, he pitied himself with a
strong, deep pity too poignent for tears, he condemned every one
with whom he had ever come in contact to endless and abnormal
punishments.&nbsp; In fact, he conveyed the impression that if a
destroying angel had been lent to him for a week it would have
had very little time for private study.&nbsp; In the lulls of his
outcry could be heard the querulous monotone of Mrs. Hoopington
and the sharp staccato barking of the fox-terrier.&nbsp;
Vladimir, who did not understand a tithe of what was being said,
sat fondling a cigarette and repeating under his breath from time
to time a vigorous <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>English adjective which he had long
ago taken affectionately into his vocabulary.&nbsp; His mind
strayed back to the youth in the old Russian folk-tale who shot
an enchanted bird with dramatic results.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the
Major, roaming round the hall like an imprisoned cyclone, had
caught sight of and joyfully pounced on the telephone apparatus,
and lost no time in ringing up the hunt secretary and announcing
his resignation of the Mastership.&nbsp; A servant had by this
time brought his horse round to the door, and in a few seconds
Mrs. Hoopington&rsquo;s shrill monotone had the field to
itself.&nbsp; But after the Major&rsquo;s display her best
efforts at vocal violence missed their full effect; it was as
though one had come straight out from a Wagner opera into a
rather tame thunderstorm.&nbsp; Realising, perhaps, that her
tirades were something of an anticlimax, Mrs. Hoopington broke
suddenly into some rather necessary tears and marched out of the
room, leaving behind her a silence almost as terrible as the
turmoil which had preceded it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do with&mdash;<i>that</i>?&rdquo; asked
Vladimir at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bury it,&rdquo; said Norah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just plain burial?&rdquo; said Vladimir, rather <!--
page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>relieved.&nbsp; He had almost expected that some of the
local clergy would have insisted on being present, or that a
salute might have to be fired over the grave.</p>
<p>And thus it came to pass that in the dusk of a November
evening the Russian boy, murmuring a few of the prayers of his
Church for luck, gave hasty but decent burial to a large polecat
under the lilac trees at Hoopington.</p>
<h2><!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>THE STRATEGIST</h2>
<p>Mrs. Jallatt&rsquo;s young people&rsquo;s parties were
severely exclusive; it came cheaper that way, because you could
ask fewer to them.&nbsp; Mrs. Jallatt didn&rsquo;t study
cheapness, but somehow she generally attained it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be about ten girls,&rdquo; speculated
Rollo, as he drove to the function, &ldquo;and I suppose four
fellows, unless the Wrotsleys bring their cousin, which Heaven
forbid.&nbsp; That would mean Jack and me against three of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rollo and the Wrotsley brethren had maintained an undying feud
almost from nursery days.&nbsp; They only met now and then in the
holidays, and the meeting was usually tragic for whichever
happened to have the fewest backers on hand.&nbsp; Rollo was
counting to-night on the presence of a devoted and muscular
partisan to hold an even <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>balance.&nbsp; As he arrived he heard his prospective
champion&rsquo;s sister apologising to the hostess for the
unavoidable absence of her brother; a moment later he noted that
the Wrotsleys <i>had</i> brought their cousin.</p>
<p>Two against three would have been exciting and possibly
unpleasant; one against three promised to be about as amusing as
a visit to the dentist.&nbsp; Rollo ordered his carriage for as
early as was decently possible, and faced the company with a
smile that he imagined the better sort of aristocrat would have
worn when mounting to the guillotine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So glad you were able to come,&rdquo; said the elder
Wrotsley heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you children will like to play games, I
suppose,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jallatt, by way of giving things a
start, and as they were too well-bred to contradict her there
only remained the question of what they were to play at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know of a good game,&rdquo; said the elder Wrotsley
innocently.&nbsp; &ldquo;The fellows leave the room and think of
a word; then they come back again, and the girls have to find out
what the word is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rollo knew the game.&nbsp; He would have <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>suggested it
himself if his faction had been in the majority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t promise to be very exciting,&rdquo;
sniffed the superior Dolores Sneep as the boys filed out of the
room.&nbsp; Rollo thought differently.&nbsp; He trusted to
Providence that Wrotsley had nothing worse than knotted
handkerchiefs at his disposal.</p>
<p>The word-choosers locked themselves in the library to ensure
that their deliberations should not be interrupted.&nbsp;
Providence turned out to be not even decently neutral; on a rack
on the library wall were a dog-whip and a whalebone
riding-switch.&nbsp; Rollo thought it criminal negligence to
leave such weapons of precision lying about.&nbsp; He was given a
choice of evils, and chose the dog-whip; the next minute or so he
spent in wondering how he could have made such a stupid
selection.&nbsp; Then they went back to the languidly expectant
females.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The word&rsquo;s &lsquo;camel,&rsquo;&rdquo; announced
the Wrotsley cousin blunderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stupid!&rdquo; screamed the girls,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to <i>guess</i> the word.&nbsp; Now
you&rsquo;ll have to go back and think of another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for worlds,&rdquo; said Rollo; &ldquo;I mean, the
word isn&rsquo;t really camel; we were rotting.&nbsp; <!-- page
88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>Pretend it&rsquo;s dromedary!&rdquo; he whispered to the
others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard them say &lsquo;dromedary&rsquo;!&nbsp; I heard
them.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care what you say; I heard them,&rdquo;
squealed the odious Dolores.&nbsp; &ldquo;With ears as long as
hers one would hear anything,&rdquo; thought Rollo savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have to go back, I suppose,&rdquo; said the
elder Wrotsley resignedly.</p>
<p>The conclave locked itself once more into the library.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Look here, I&rsquo;m not going through that dog-whip
business again,&rdquo; protested Rollo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, dear,&rdquo; said the elder Wrotsley;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll try the whalebone switch this time, and
you&rsquo;ll know which hurts most.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only by
personal experience that one finds out these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was swiftly borne in upon Rollo that his earlier selection
of the dog-whip had been a really sound one.&nbsp; The conclave
gave his under-lip time to steady itself while it debated the
choice of the necessary word.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mustang&rdquo; was no
good, as half the girls wouldn&rsquo;t know what it meant;
finally &ldquo;quagga&rdquo; was pitched on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must come and sit down over here,&rdquo; chorused
the investigating committee on <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>their return;
but Rollo was obdurate in insisting that the questioned person
always stood up.&nbsp; On the whole, it was a relief when the
game was ended and supper was announced.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jallatt did not stint her young guests, but the more
expensive delicacies of her supper-table were never unnecessarily
duplicated, and it was usually good policy to take what you
wanted while it was still there.&nbsp; On this occasion she had
provided sixteen peaches to &ldquo;go round&rdquo; among fourteen
children; it was really not her fault that the two Wrotsleys and
their cousin, foreseeing the long foodless drive home, had each
quietly pocketed an extra peach, but it was distinctly trying for
Dolores and the fat and good-natured Agnes Blaik to be left with
one peach between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we had better halve it,&rdquo; said Dolores
sourly.</p>
<p>But Agnes was fat first and good-natured afterwards; those
were her guiding principles in life.&nbsp; She was profuse in her
sympathy for Dolores, but she hastily devoured the peach,
explaining that it would spoil it to divide it; the juice ran out
so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what would you all like to do?&rdquo; <!-- page
90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>demanded Mrs. Jallatt by way of diversion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The professional conjurer whom I had engaged has failed me
at the last moment.&nbsp; Can any of you recite?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were symptoms of a general panic.&nbsp; Dolores was
known to recite &ldquo;Locksley Hall&rdquo; on the least
provocation.&nbsp; There had been occasions when her opening
line, &ldquo;Comrades, leave me here a little,&rdquo; had been
taken as a literal injunction by a large section of her
hearers.&nbsp; There was a murmur of relief when Rollo hastily
declared that he could do a few conjuring tricks.&nbsp; He had
never done one in his life, but those two visits to the library
had goaded him to unusual recklessness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen conjuring chaps take coins and cards
out of people,&rdquo; he announced; &ldquo;well, I&rsquo;m going
to take more interesting things out of some of you.&nbsp; Mice,
for instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not mice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shrill protest rose, as he had foreseen, from the majority
of his audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, fruit, them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The amended proposal was received with approval.&nbsp; Agnes
positively beamed.</p>
<p>Without more ado Rollo made straight <!-- page 91--><a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>for his trio
of enemies, plunged his hand successively into their
breast-pockets, and produced three peaches.&nbsp; There was no
applause, but no amount of hand-clapping would have given the
performer as much pleasure as the silence which greeted his
coup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, we were in the know,&rdquo; said the
Wrotsley cousin lamely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s done it,&rdquo; chuckled Rollo to
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they <i>had</i> been confederates they would have
sworn they knew nothing about it,&rdquo; said Dolores, with
piercing conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know any more tricks?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Jallatt
hurriedly.</p>
<p>Rollo did not.&nbsp; He hinted that he might have changed the
three peaches into something else, but Agnes had already
converted one into girl-food, so nothing more could be done in
that direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a game,&rdquo; said the elder Wrotsley heavily,
&ldquo;where the fellows go out of the room, and think of some
character in history; then they come back and act him, and the
girls have to guess who it&rsquo;s meant for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I must be going,&rdquo; said Rollo to
his hostess.</p>
<p><!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>&ldquo;Your carriage won&rsquo;t be here for another
twenty minutes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jallatt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a fine evening I think I&rsquo;ll walk
and meet it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining rather steadily at present.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve just time to play that historical game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t heard Dolores recite,&rdquo; said
Rollo desperately; as soon as he had said it he realised his
mistake.&nbsp; Confronted with the alternative of &ldquo;Locksley
Hall,&rdquo; public opinion declared unanimously for the history
game.</p>
<p>Rollo played his last card.&nbsp; In an undertone meant
apparently for the Wrotsley boy, but carefully pitched to reach
Agnes, he observed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, old man; we&rsquo;ll go and finish those
chocolates we left in the library.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s only fair that the girls should take
their turn in going out,&rdquo; exclaimed Agnes briskly.&nbsp;
She was great on fairness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said the others; &ldquo;there are too
many of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, four of us can go.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be one of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Agnes darted off towards the library, followed by three
less eager damsels.</p>
<p><!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>Rollo sank into a chair and smiled ever so faintly at
the Wrotsleys, just a momentary baring of the teeth; an otter,
escaping from the fangs of the hounds into the safety of a deep
pool, might have given a similar demonstration of feelings.</p>
<p>From the library came the sound of moving furniture.&nbsp;
Agnes was leaving nothing unturned in her quest for the mythical
chocolates.&nbsp; And then came a more blessed sound, wheels
crunching wet gravel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been a most enjoyable evening,&rdquo; said Rollo
to his hostess.</p>

94</span>CROSS CURRENTS</h2>
<p>Vanessa Pennington had a husband who was poor, with few
extenuating circumstances, and an admirer who, though comfortably
rich, was cumbered with a sense of honour.&nbsp; His wealth made
him welcome in Vanessa&rsquo;s eyes, but his code of what was
right impelled him to go away and forget her, or at the most to
think of her in the intervals of doing a great many other
things.&nbsp; And although Alaric Clyde loved Vanessa, and
thought he should always go on loving her, he gradually and
unconsciously allowed himself to be wooed and won by a more
alluring mistress; he fancied that his continued shunning of the
haunts of men was a self-imposed exile, but his heart was caught
in the spell of the Wilderness, and the Wilderness was kind and
beautiful to him.&nbsp; When one is young and strong and
unfettered the wild earth can be very kind <!-- page 95--><a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>and very
beautiful.&nbsp; Witness the legion of men who were once young
and unfettered and now eat out their souls in dustbins, because,
having erstwhile known and loved the Wilderness, they broke from
her thrall and turned aside into beaten paths.</p>
<p>In the high waste places of the world Clyde roamed and hunted
and dreamed, death-dealing and gracious as some god of Hellas,
moving with his horses and servants and four-footed camp
followers from one dwelling ground to another, a welcome guest
among wild primitive village folk and nomads, a friend and slayer
of the fleet, shy beasts around him.&nbsp; By the shores of misty
upland lakes he shot the wild fowl that had winged their way to
him across half the old world; beyond Bokhara he watched the wild
Aryan horsemen at their gambols; watched, too, in some dim-lit
tea-house one of those beautiful uncouth dances that one can
never wholly forget; or, making a wide cast down to the valley of
the Tigris, swam and rolled in its snow-cooled racing
waters.&nbsp; Vanessa, meanwhile, in a Bayswater back street, was
making out the weekly laundry list, attending bargain sales, and,
in her more adventurous moments, trying new ways of cooking
whiting.&nbsp; <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>Occasionally she went to bridge
parties, where, if the play was not illuminating, at least one
learned a great deal about the private life of some of the Royal
and Imperial Houses.&nbsp; Vanessa, in a way, was glad that Clyde
had done the proper thing.&nbsp; She had a strong natural bias
towards respectability, though she would have preferred to have
been respectable in smarter surroundings, where her example would
have done more good.&nbsp; To be beyond reproach was one thing,
but it would have been nicer to have been nearer to the Park.</p>
<p>And then of a sudden her regard for respectability and
Clyde&rsquo;s sense of what was right were thrown on the
scrap-heap of unnecessary things.&nbsp; They had been useful and
highly important in their time, but the death of Vanessa&rsquo;s
husband made them of no immediate moment.</p>
<p>The news of the altered condition of things followed Clyde
with leisurely persistence from one place of call to another, and
at last ran him to a standstill somewhere in the Orenburg
Steppe.&nbsp; He would have found it exceedingly difficult to
analyse his feelings on receipt of the tidings.&nbsp; The Fates
had unexpectedly (and perhaps just a little <!-- page 97--><a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>officiously)
removed an obstacle from his path.&nbsp; He supposed he was
overjoyed, but he missed the feeling of elation which he had
experienced some four months ago when he had bagged a
snow-leopard with a lucky shot after a day&rsquo;s fruitless
stalking.&nbsp; Of course he would go back and ask Vanessa to
marry him, but he was determined on enforcing a condition; on no
account would he desert his newer love.&nbsp; Vanessa would have
to agree to come out into the Wilderness with him.</p>
<p>The lady hailed the return of her lover with even more relief
than had been occasioned by his departure.&nbsp; The death of
John Pennington had left his widow in circumstances which were
more straitened than ever, and the Park had receded even from her
notepaper, where it had long been retained as a courtesy title on
the principle that addresses are given to us to conceal our
whereabouts.&nbsp; Certainly she was more independent now than
heretofore, but independence, which means so much to many women,
was of little account to Vanessa, who came under the heading of
the mere female.&nbsp; She made little ado about accepting
Clyde&rsquo;s condition, and announced herself ready to <!-- page
98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>follow him to the end of the world; as the world was
round she nourished a complacent idea that in the ordinary course
of things one would find oneself in the neighbourhood of Hyde
Park Corner sooner or later no matter how far afield one
wandered.</p>
<p>East of Budapest her complacency began to filter away, and
when she saw her husband treating the Black Sea with a
familiarity which she had never been able to assume towards the
English Channel, misgivings began to crowd in upon her.&nbsp;
Adventures which would have presented an amusing and enticing
aspect to a better-bred woman aroused in Vanessa only the twin
sensations of fright and discomfort.&nbsp; Flies bit her, and she
was persuaded that it was only sheer boredom that prevented
camels from doing the same.&nbsp; Clyde did his best, and a very
good best it was, to infuse something of the banquet into their
prolonged desert picnics, but even snow-cooled Heidsieck lost its
flavour when you were convinced that the dusky cupbearer who
served it with such reverent elegance was only waiting a
convenient opportunity to cut your throat.&nbsp; It was useless
for Clyde to give Yussuf a character for devotion such as is
rarely found in any <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>Western servant.&nbsp; Vanessa was
well enough educated to know that all dusky-skinned people take
human life as unconcernedly as Bayswater folk take singing
lessons.</p>
<p>And with a growing irritation and querulousness on her part
came a further disenchantment, born of the inability of husband
and wife to find a common ground of interest.&nbsp; The habits
and migrations of the sand grouse, the folklore and customs of
Tartars and Turkomans, the points of a Cossack pony&mdash;these
were matter which evoked only a bored indifference in
Vanessa.&nbsp; On the other hand, Clyde was not thrilled on being
informed that the Queen of Spain detested mauve, or that a
certain Royal duchess, for whose tastes he was never likely to be
called on to cater, nursed a violent but perfectly respectable
passion for beef olives.</p>
<p>Vanessa began to arrive at the conclusion that a husband who
added a roving disposition to a settled income was a mixed
blessing.&nbsp; It was one thing to go to the end of the world;
it was quite another thing to make oneself at home there.&nbsp;
Even respectability seemed to lose some of its virtue when one
practised it in a tent.</p>
<p><!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>Bored and disillusioned with the drift of her new life,
Vanessa was undisguisedly glad when distraction offered itself in
the person of Mr. Dobrinton, a chance acquaintance whom they had
first run against in the primitive hostelry of a benighted
Caucasian town.&nbsp; Dobrinton was elaborately British, in
deference perhaps to the memory of his mother, who was said to
have derived part of her origin from an English governess who had
come to Lemberg a long way back in the last century.&nbsp; If you
had called him Dobrinski when off his guard he would probably
have responded readily enough; holding, no doubt, that the end
crowns all, he had taken a slight liberty with the family
patronymic.&nbsp; To look at, Mr. Dobrinton was not a very
attractive specimen of masculine humanity, but in Vanessa&rsquo;s
eyes he was a link with that civilisation which Clyde seemed so
ready to ignore and forgo.&nbsp; He could sing
&ldquo;Yip-I-Addy&rdquo; and spoke of several duchesses as if he
knew them&mdash;in his more inspired moments almost as if they
knew him.&nbsp; He even pointed out blemishes in the cuisine or
cellar departments of some of the more august London restaurants,
a species of Higher Criticism which was listened to <!-- page
101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>by
Vanessa in awe-stricken admiration.&nbsp; And, above all, he
sympathised, at first discreetly, afterwards with more latitude,
with her fretful discontent at Clyde&rsquo;s nomadic
instincts.&nbsp; Business connected with oil-wells had brought
Dobrinton to the neighbourhood of Baku; the pleasure of appealing
to an appreciative female audience induced him to deflect his
return journey so as to coincide a good deal with his new
aquaintances&rsquo; line of march.&nbsp; And while Clyde
trafficked with Persian horse-dealers or hunted the wild grey
pigs in their lairs and added to his notes on Central Asian
game-fowl, Dobrinton and the lady discussed the ethics of desert
respectability from points of view that showed a daily tendency
to converge.&nbsp; And one evening Clyde dined alone, reading
between the courses a long letter from Vanessa, justifying her
action in flitting to more civilised lands with a more congenial
companion.</p>
<p>It was distinctly evil luck for Vanessa, who really was
thoroughly respectable at heart, that she and her lover should
run into the hands of Kurdish brigands on the first day of their
flight.&nbsp; To be mewed up in a squalid Kurdish village in
close companionship with a man who was only your husband <!--
page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>by adoption, and to have the attention of all Europe
drawn to your plight, was about the least respectable thing that
could happen.&nbsp; And there were international complications,
which made things worse.&nbsp; &ldquo;English lady and her
husband, of foreign nationality, held by Kurdish brigands who
demand ransom&rdquo; had been the report of the nearest
Consul.&nbsp; Although Dobrinton was British at heart, the other
portions of him belonged to the Habsburgs, and though the
Habsburgs took no great pride or pleasure in this particular unit
of their wide and varied possessions, and would gladly have
exchanged him for some interesting bird or mammal for the
Schoenbrunn Park, the code of international dignity demanded that
they should display a decent solicitude for his
restoration.&nbsp; And while the Foreign Offices of the two
countries were taking the usual steps to secure the release of
their respective subjects a further horrible complication
ensued.&nbsp; Clyde, following on the track of the fugitives, not
with any special desire to overtake them, but with a dim feeling
that it was expected of him, fell into the hands of the same
community of brigands.&nbsp; Diplomacy, while anxious to do its
best for a lady in misfortune, showed signs of becoming restive
<!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>at this expansion of its task; as a frivolous young
gentleman in Downing Street remarked, &ldquo;Any husband of Mrs.
Dobrinton&rsquo;s we shall be glad to extricate, but let us know
how many there are of them.&rdquo;&nbsp; For a woman who valued
respectability Vanessa really had no luck.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the situation of the captives was not free from
embarrassment.&nbsp; When Clyde explained to the Kurdish headmen
the nature of his relationship with the runaway couple they were
gravely sympathetic, but vetoed any idea of summary vengeance,
since the Habsburgs would be sure to insist on the delivery of
Dobrinton alive, and in a reasonably undamaged condition.&nbsp;
They did not object to Clyde administering a beating to his rival
for half an hour every Monday and Thursday, but Dobrinton turned
such a sickly green when he heard of this arrangement that the
chief was obliged to withdraw the concession.</p>
<p>And so, in the cramped quarters of a mountain hut, the
ill-assorted trio watched the insufferable hours crawl slowly
by.&nbsp; Dobrinton was too frightened to be conversational,
Vanessa was too mortified to open her lips, and Clyde was moodily
silent.&nbsp; <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>The little Limberg
<i>n&eacute;gociant</i> plucked up heart once to give a quavering
rendering of &ldquo;Yip-I-Addy,&rdquo; but when he reached the
statement &ldquo;home was never like this&rdquo; Vanessa
tearfully begged him to stop.&nbsp; And silence fastened itself
with growing insistence on the three captives who were so
tragically herded together; thrice a day they drew near to one
another to swallow the meal that had been prepared for them, like
desert beasts meeting in mute suspended hostility at the drinking
pool, and then drew back to resume the vigil of waiting.</p>
<p>Clyde was less carefully watched than the others.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Jealousy will keep him to the woman&rsquo;s side,&rdquo;
thought his Kurdish captors.&nbsp; They did not know that his
wilder, truer love was calling to him with a hundred voices from
beyond the village bounds.&nbsp; And one evening, finding that he
was not getting the attention to which he was entitled, Clyde
slipped away down the mountain side and resumed his study of
Central Asian game-fowl.&nbsp; The remaining captives were
guarded henceforth with greater rigour, but Dobrinton at any rate
scarcely regretted Clyde&rsquo;s departure.</p>
<p>The long arm, or perhaps one might better <!-- page 105--><a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>say the
long purse, of diplomacy at last effected the release of the
prisoners, but the Habsburgs were never to enjoy the guerdon of
their outlay.&nbsp; On the quay of the little Black Sea port,
where the rescued pair came once more into contact with
civilisation, Dobrinton was bitten by a dog which was assumed to
be mad, though it may only have been indiscriminating.&nbsp; The
victim did not wait for symptoms of rabies to declare themselves,
but died forthwith of fright, and Vanessa made the homeward
journey alone, conscious somehow of a sense of slightly restored
respectability.&nbsp; Clyde, in the intervals of correcting the
proofs of his book on the game-fowl of Central Asia, found time
to press a divorce suit through the Courts, and as soon as
possible hied him away to the congenial solitudes of the Gobi
Desert to collect material for a work on the fauna of that
region.&nbsp; Vanessa, by virtue perhaps of her earlier intimacy
with the cooking rites of the whiting, obtained a place on the
kitchen staff of a West End club.&nbsp; It was not brilliant, but
at least it was within two minutes of the Park.</p>

years!&nbsp; This is fate!</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: Fate!&nbsp; Nothing of the sort; it&rsquo;s only
me.&nbsp; You men are always such fatalists.&nbsp; I deferred my
departure three whole weeks, in order to come out in the same
boat that I saw you were travelling by.&nbsp; I bribed the
steward to put out chairs side by side in an <!-- page 107--><a

107</span>unfrequented corner, and I took enormous pains to be
looking particularly attractive this morning, and then you say
&ldquo;This is fate.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am looking particularly
attractive, am I not?</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: More than ever.&nbsp; Time has only added a
ripeness to your charms.</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: I knew you&rsquo;d put it exactly in those
words.&nbsp; The phraseology of love-making is awfully limited,
isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; After all, the chief charm is in the fact
of being made love to.&nbsp; You <i>are</i> making love to me,
aren&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: Emily dearest, I had already begun making
advances, even before you sat down here.&nbsp; I also bribed the
steward to put our seats together in a secluded corner.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You may consider it done, sir,&rdquo; was his reply.&nbsp;
That was immediately after breakfast.</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: How like a man to have his breakfast first.&nbsp;
I attended to the seat business as soon as I left my cabin.</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: Don&rsquo;t be unreasonable.&nbsp; It was only at
breakfast that I discovered your blessed presence on the
boat.&nbsp; I paid violent and unusual attention to a flapper all
through the meal in order to make you jealous.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
probably in her cabin writing reams about me to a fellow-flapper
at this very moment.</p>
<p><!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

trouble to make me jealous, Dickie.&nbsp; You did that years ago,
when you married another woman.</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: Well, you had gone and married another
man&mdash;a widower, too, at that.</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: Well, there&rsquo;s no particular harm in marrying
a widower, I suppose.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m ready to do it again, if I
meet a really nice one.</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: Look here, Emily, it&rsquo;s not fair to go at
that rate.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a lap ahead of me the whole
time.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my place to propose to you; all
you&rsquo;ve got to do is to say &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

we needn&rsquo;t dawdle over that part.</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: Oh, well&mdash;</p>
<p>(They look at each other, then suddenly embrace with
considerable energy.)</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: We dead-heated it that time.&nbsp; (Suddenly
jumping to his feet) Oh, d--- I&rsquo;d forgotten!</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: Forgotten what?</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: The children.&nbsp; I ought to have told
you.&nbsp; Do you mind children?</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: Not in moderate quantities.&nbsp; How many have
you got?</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i> (counting hurriedly on his fingers): Five.</p>
<p><!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span><i>Em.</i>: Five!</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i> (anxiously): Is that too many?</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: It&rsquo;s rather a number.&nbsp; The worst of it
is, I&rsquo;ve some myself.</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: Many?</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: Eight.</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: Eight in six years!&nbsp; Oh, Emily!</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: Only four were my own.&nbsp; The other four were
by my husband&rsquo;s first marriage.&nbsp; Still, that
practically makes eight.</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: And eight and five make thirteen.&nbsp; We
can&rsquo;t start our married life with thirteen children; it
would be most unlucky.&nbsp; (Walks up and down in
agitation.)&nbsp; Some way must be found out of this.&nbsp; If we
could only bring them down to twelve.&nbsp; Thirteen is so
horribly unlucky.</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: Isn&rsquo;t there some way by which we could part
with one or two? Don&rsquo;t the French want more children?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve often seen articles about it in the <i>Figaro</i>.</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: I fancy they want French children.&nbsp; Mine
don&rsquo;t even speak French.</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: There&rsquo;s always a chance that one of them
might turn out depraved and vicious, and then you could disown
him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard of that being done.</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: But, good gracious, you&rsquo;ve got to <!-- page
110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>educate him first.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t expect a boy
to be vicious till he&rsquo;s been to a good school.</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: Why couldn&rsquo;t he be naturally depraved?&nbsp;
Lots of boys are.</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: Only when they inherit it from depraved
parents.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s any
depravity in me, do you?</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: It sometimes skips a generation, you know.&nbsp;
Weren&rsquo;t any of your family bad?</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: There was an aunt who was never spoken of.</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: There you are!</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: But one can&rsquo;t build too much on that.&nbsp;
In mid-Victorian days they labelled all sorts of things as
unspeakable that we should speak about quite tolerantly.&nbsp; I
dare say this particular aunt had only married a Unitarian, or
rode to hounds on both sides of her horse, or something of that
sort.&nbsp; Anyhow, we can&rsquo;t wait indefinitely for one of
the children to take after a doubtfully depraved
great-aunt.&nbsp; Something else must be thought of.</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: Don&rsquo;t people ever adopt children from other
families?</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: I&rsquo;ve heard of it being done by childless
couples, and those sort of people&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span><i>Em.</i>: Hush!&nbsp; Some one&rsquo;s coming.&nbsp;
Who is it?</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: Mrs. Paly-Paget.</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: The very person!</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: What, to adopt a child?&nbsp; Hasn&rsquo;t she
got any?</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: Only one miserable hen-baby.</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: Let&rsquo;s sound her on the subject.</p>
<p>(Enter Mrs. Paly-Paget, R.)</p>
<p>Ah, good morning.&nbsp; Mrs. Paly-Paget.&nbsp; I was just
wondering at breakfast where did we meet last?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. P.-P.</i>: At the Criterion, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>(Drops into vacant chair.)</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: At the Criterion, of course.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. P.-P.</i>: I was dining with Lord and Lady
Slugford.&nbsp; Charming people, but so mean.&nbsp; They took us
afterwards to the Velodrome, to see some dancer interpreting
Mendelssohn&rsquo;s &ldquo;song without clothes.&rdquo; We were
all packed up in a little box near the roof, and you may imagine
how hot it was.&nbsp; It was like a Turkish bath.&nbsp; And, of
course, one couldn&rsquo;t see anything.</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: Then it was not like a Turkish bath.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. P.-P.</i>: Major!</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: We were just talking of you when you joined
us.</p>
<p><!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span><i>Mrs. P.-P.</i>: Really!&nbsp; Nothing very dreadful,
I hope.</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: Oh dear, no!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s too early on the
voyage for that sort of thing.&nbsp; We were feeling rather sorry
for you.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. P.-P.</i>: Sorry for me?&nbsp; Whatever for?</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: Your childless hearth and all that, you
know.&nbsp; No little pattering feet.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. P.-P.</i>: Major!&nbsp; How dare you?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
got my little girl, I suppose you know.&nbsp; Her feet can patter
as well as other children&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: Only one pair of feet.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. P.-P.</i>: Certainly.&nbsp; My child isn&rsquo;t a
centipede.&nbsp; Considering the way they move us about in those
horrid jungle stations, without a decent bungalow to set
one&rsquo;s foot in, I consider I&rsquo;ve got a hearthless
child, rather than a childless hearth.&nbsp; Thank you for your
sympathy all the same.&nbsp; I dare say it was well meant.&nbsp;
Impertinence often is.</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: Dear Mrs. Paly-Paget, we were only feeling sorry
for your sweet little girl when she grows older, you know.&nbsp;
No little brothers and sisters to play with.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. P.-P.</i>: Mrs. Carewe, this conversation strikes me
as being indelicate, to say the least of it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
only been married two and a <!-- page 113--><a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>half years,
and my family is naturally a small one.</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: Isn&rsquo;t it rather an exaggeration to talk of
one little female child as a family?&nbsp; A family suggests
numbers.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. P.-P.</i>: Really, Major, you language is
extraordinary.&nbsp; I dare say I&rsquo;ve only got a little
female child, as you call it, at present&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: Oh, it won&rsquo;t change into a boy later on, if
that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re counting on.&nbsp; Take our word
for it; we&rsquo;ve had so much more experience in these affairs
than you have.&nbsp; Once a female, always a female.&nbsp; Nature
is not infallible, but she always abides by her mistakes.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. P.-P.</i> (rising): Major Dumbarton, these boats are
uncomfortably small, but I trust we shall find ample
accommodation for avoiding each other&rsquo;s society during the
rest of the voyage.&nbsp; The same wish applies to you, Mrs.
Carewe.</p>
<p>(Exit Mrs. Paly-Paget, L.)</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: What an unnatural mother!&nbsp; (Sinks into
chair.)</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: I wouldn&rsquo;t trust a child with any one who
had a temper like hers.&nbsp; Oh, Dickie, why did you go and have
such a large family?&nbsp; <!-- page 114--><a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>You always
said you wanted me to be the mother of your children.</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: I wasn&rsquo;t going to wait while you were
founding and fostering dynasties in other directions.&nbsp; Why
you couldn&rsquo;t be content to have children of your own,
without collecting them like batches of postage stamps I
can&rsquo;t think.&nbsp; The idea of marrying a man with four
children!</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: Well, you&rsquo;re asking me to marry one with
five.</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: Five!&nbsp; (Springing to his feet)&nbsp; Did I
say five?</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: You certainly said five.</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: Oh, Emily, supposing I&rsquo;ve miscounted
them!&nbsp; Listen now, keep count with me.&nbsp;
Richard&mdash;that&rsquo;s after me, of course.</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: One.</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: Albert-Victor&mdash;that must have been in
Coronation year.</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: Two!</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: Maud.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s called after&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: Never mind who&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s called
after.&nbsp; Three!</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: And Gerald.</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: Four!</p>
<p><i>Maj.</i>: That&rsquo;s the lot.</p>
<p><i>Em.</i>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span><i>Maj.</i>: I swear that&rsquo;s the lot.&nbsp; I must
have counted Albert-Victor as two.</p>

<h2><!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>THE MOUSE</h2>
<p>Theodoric Voler had been brought up, from infancy to the
confines of middle age, by a fond mother whose chief solicitude
had been to keep him screened from what she called the coarser
realities of life.&nbsp; When she died she left Theodoric alone
in a world that was as real as ever, and a good deal coarser than
he considered it had any need to be.&nbsp; To a man of his
temperament and upbringing even a simple railway journey was
crammed with petty annoyances and minor discords, and as he
settled himself down in a second-class compartment one September
morning he was conscious of ruffled feelings and general mental
discomposure.&nbsp; He had been staying at a country vicarage,
the inmates of which had been certainly neither brutal nor
bacchanalian, but their supervision of the domestic establishment
had been of that <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>lax order which invites
disaster.&nbsp; The pony carriage that was to take him to the
station had never been properly ordered, and when the moment for
his departure drew near the handy-man who should have produced
the required article was nowhere to be found.&nbsp; In this
emergency Theodoric, to his mute but very intense disgust, found
himself obliged to collaborate with the vicar&rsquo;s daughter in
the task of harnessing the pony, which necessitated groping about
in an ill-lighted outhouse called a stable, and smelling very
like one&mdash;except in patches where it smelt of mice.&nbsp;
Without being actually afraid of mice, Theodoric classed them
among the coarser incidents of life, and considered that
Providence, with a little exercise of moral courage, might long
ago have recognised that they were not indispensable, and have
withdrawn them from circulation.&nbsp; As the train glided out of
the station Theodoric&rsquo;s nervous imagination accused himself
of exhaling a weak odour of stable-yard, and possibly of
displaying a mouldy straw or two on his usually well-brushed
garments.&nbsp; Fortunately the only other occupant of the
compartment, a lady of about the same age as himself, seemed <!--
page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>inclined for slumber rather than scrutiny; the train
was not due to stop till the terminus was reached, in about an
hour&rsquo;s time, and the carriage was of the old-fashioned
sort, that held no communication with a corridor, therefore no
further travelling companions were likely to intrude on
Theodoric&rsquo;s semi-privacy.&nbsp; And yet the train had
scarcely attained its normal speed before he became reluctantly
but vividly aware that he was not alone with the slumbering lady;
he was not even alone in his own clothes.&nbsp; A warm, creeping
movement over his flesh betrayed the unwelcome and highly
resented presence, unseen but poignant, of a strayed mouse, that
had evidently dashed into its present retreat during the episode
of the pony harnessing.&nbsp; Furtive stamps and shakes and
wildly directed pinches failed to dislodge the intruder, whose
motto, indeed, seemed to be Excelsior; and the lawful occupant of
the clothes lay back against the cushions and endeavoured rapidly
to evolve some means for putting an end to the dual
ownership.&nbsp; It was unthinkable that he should continue for
the space of a whole hour in the horrible position of a Rowton
House for vagrant mice (already his imagination <!-- page
119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>had at least doubled the numbers of the alien
invasion).&nbsp; On the other hand, nothing less drastic than
partial disrobing would ease him of his tormentor, and to undress
in the presence of a lady, even for so laudable a purpose, was an
idea that made his eartips tingle in a blush of abject
shame.&nbsp; He had never been able to bring himself even to the
mild exposure of open-work socks in the presence of the fair
sex.&nbsp; And yet&mdash;the lady in this case was to all
appearances soundly and securely asleep; the mouse, on the other
hand, seemed to be trying to crowd a Wanderjahr into a few
strenuous minutes.&nbsp; If there is any truth in the theory of
transmigration, this particular mouse must certainly have been in
a former state a member of the Alpine Club.&nbsp; Sometimes in
its eagerness it lost its footing and slipped for half an inch or
so; and then, in fright, or more probably temper, it bit.&nbsp;
Theodoric was goaded into the most audacious undertaking of his
life.&nbsp; Crimsoning to the hue of a beetroot and keeping an
agonised watch on his slumbering fellow-traveller, he swiftly and
noiselessly secured the ends of his railway-rug to the racks on
either side of the carriage, so that a substantial curtain <!--
page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>hung athwart the compartment.&nbsp; In the narrow
dressing-room that he had thus improvised he proceeded with
violent haste to extricate himself partially and the mouse
entirely from the surrounding casings of tweed and
half-wool.&nbsp; As the unravelled mouse gave a wild leap to the
floor, the rug, slipping its fastening at either end, also came
down with a heart-curdling flop, and almost simultaneously the
awakened sleeper opened her eyes.&nbsp; With a movement almost
quicker than the mouse&rsquo;s, Theodoric pounced on the rug, and
hauled its ample folds chin-high over his dismantled person as he
collapsed into the further corner of the carriage.&nbsp; The
blood raced and beat in the veins of his neck and forehead, while
he waited dumbly for the communication-cord to be pulled.&nbsp;
The lady, however, contented herself with a silent stare at her
strangely muffled companion.&nbsp; How much had she seen,
Theodoric queried to himself, and in any case what on earth must
she think of his present posture?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I have caught a chill,&rdquo; he ventured
desperately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was just going to ask you if you would open this
window.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>&ldquo;I fancy it&rsquo;s malaria,&rdquo; he added, his
teeth chattering slightly, as much from fright as from a desire
to support his theory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some brandy in my hold-all, if
you&rsquo;ll kindly reach it down for me,&rdquo; said his
companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for worlds&mdash;I mean, I never take anything for
it,&rdquo; he assured her earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you caught it in the Tropics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Theodoric, whose acquaintance with the Tropics was limited to
an annual present of a chest of tea from an uncle in Ceylon, felt
that even the malaria was slipping from him.&nbsp; Would it be
possible, he wondered, to disclose the real state of affairs to
her in small instalments?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid of mice?&rdquo; he ventured, growing, if
possible, more scarlet in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless they came in quantities, like those that ate
up Bishop Hatto.&nbsp; Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had one crawling inside my clothes just now,&rdquo;
said Theodoric in a voice that hardly seemed his own.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was a most awkward situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been, if you wear your clothes at all
tight,&rdquo; she observed; &ldquo;but mice have strange ideas of
comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>&ldquo;I had to get rid of it while you were
asleep,&rdquo; he continued; then, with a gulp, he added,
&ldquo;it was getting rid of it that brought me to&mdash;to
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely leaving off one small mouse wouldn&rsquo;t bring
on a chill,&rdquo; she exclaimed, with a levity that Theodoric
accounted abominable.</p>
<p>Evidently she had detected something of his predicament, and
was enjoying his confusion.&nbsp; All the blood in his body
seemed to have mobilised in one concentrated blush, and an agony
of abasement, worse than a myriad mice, crept up and down over
his soul.&nbsp; And then, as reflection began to assert itself,
sheer terror took the place of humiliation.&nbsp; With every
minute that passed the train was rushing nearer to the crowded
and bustling terminus where dozens of prying eyes would be
exchanged for the one paralysing pair that watched him from the
further corner of the carriage.&nbsp; There was one slender
despairing chance, which the next few minutes must decide.&nbsp;
His fellow-traveller might relapse into a blessed slumber.&nbsp;
But as the minutes throbbed by that chance ebbed away.&nbsp; The
furtive glance which Theodoric stole at her from time <!-- page
123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>to
time disclosed only an unwinking wakefulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we must be getting near now,&rdquo; she
presently observed.</p>
<p>Theodoric had already noted with growing terror the recurring
stacks of small, ugly dwellings that heralded the journey&rsquo;s
end.&nbsp; The words acted as a signal.&nbsp; Like a hunted beast
breaking cover and dashing madly towards some other haven of
momentary safety he threw aside his rug, and struggled
frantically into his dishevelled garments.&nbsp; He was conscious
of dull surburban stations racing past the window, of a choking,
hammering sensation in his throat and heart, and of an icy
silence in that corner towards which he dared not look.&nbsp;
Then as he sank back in his seat, clothed and almost delirious,
the train slowed down to a final crawl, and the woman spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you be so kind,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;as to
get me a porter to put me into a cab?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a shame to
trouble you when you&rsquo;re feeling unwell, but being blind
makes one so helpless at a railway station.&rdquo;</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
